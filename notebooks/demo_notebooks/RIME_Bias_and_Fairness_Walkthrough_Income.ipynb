    "# **RI Bias and Fairness Income Classification Walkthrough**\n",
    "\n",
    "You are a data scientist at the Census Bureau. The data science team has been tasked with implementing a classification model to predict whether an individual's income is above $50k USD. The primary goal of this project is to test the hypothesis that income inequality is _not_ dependent on protected attributes. One could imagine such models being used downstream for various purposes, such as loan approval or funding allocation. A biased model could yield disadvantageous outcomes for protected groups. For instance, we may find that an individual with a specific race or race/gender combination causes the model to consistently predict a low income, causing a higher rate of loan rejection. \n",
