# Configuring data sources

Administrators can configure data sources that the RI Platform can access.
Sensitive information, such as access tokens, are stored in a secret manager
service built using Hashicorp Vault.

## Supported data sources

The RI Platform supports the following data sources.

### Configurable through the RI Platform UI

* [Databricks Deltalake](/for_data_scientists/how_to_guides/integrations/data/databricks_deltalake.md)

### Configurable at deploy time

These sources can only be configured when deploying an RI Platform instance:

* Amazon S3 
* Google Cloud Storage

## Adding a data source

An administrator can add or modify a data source that RI Platform can use. 

1.  Sign in to a RIME instance.  
      The Workspaces page appears.
2.  Click the three-dot menu at the right side of a workspace and select *Manage Workspace*.  
      The Workspace Settings page appears. The user account logged in must have the Workspace
      administrator role for the selected workspace.
3.  Click *Data Sources* in the left navigation bar.  
      The Data Sources configuration pane appears.
4.  Click *Add Data Source*.  
      The Add Data Source dialog box appears.
5.  In *Name*, type a name for the data source.
6.  From the *Data Source Type* drop-down, choose a type.
7.  In *Server Hostname*, type the fully-qualified domain name (FQDN) for the server.
8.  In *HTTP Path*, type the path to the data source.
9.  From the *Credentials Privilege* drop-down, choose a privilege level.
      | Level     | Description                                                                       |
      |-----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
      | Workspace | All users share a single access token to authenticate.                            |
      | Members   | Each user configures their credentials and uses a personal token to authenticate. |
10. Click *Save*.

The new data source is now available to the RI Platform.
