# FAQ

1. **How Do I Upgrade My Production Version of RIME?**

    New major versions of RIME are released on a six-week release cycle. There are
    often minor version releases with fixes for bugs and the like inbetween these
    releases as well. The upgrade process involves updating the RIME cluster image,
    updating the image itself, and then updating the SDK. See [Updating RIME](/for_admins/installation_guide/enterprise/installation/update.md)
    for detailed instructions on this process.

2. **How Do I Extend My Product License?**

    If your license is expiring soon and you would like to extend it, you can reach out to your Robust Intelligence representative directly or (for Administrators) use the "Contact Sales" button in your Subscription settings.

3. **My Network Firewall is Marking the RIME Web Client as Insecure.**

    If your web client is marked as insecure, verify that you have configured an ACM (AWS Certificate Manager) SSL/TLS certificate for the domain.
