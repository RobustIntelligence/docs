# Native user authentication

User authentication for an RI Platform instance is mediated by username and
password pairs. A password is assigned at the time the user account is created.

A user with the Instance administrator role can change the password of another
user account on the instance.

1.  Sign in to a user account that has administrative privileges for an RI
    Platform instance.  
    >    The Workspaces page appears.
2.  Click the *Settings* icon in the lower left.  
    >    The Organization Settings page appears.
3.  Click *Members*.
    >   The Members pane appears.
4.  Click the three-dot icon at the right of a user and select *Reset Password*.
    >   The Reset Password dialog box appears.
5.  In *Current Passsword*, type the current password for the user account.
6.  In *New Password*, type the new password.
7.  In *Confirm Password*, type the new password again.
8.  Click *Reset*.

## Personal password reset

A user account can reset the password for that account.

1.  Sign in to a user account.  
    >    The Workspaces page appears.
2.  From the drop-down in the top right, select *Personal Information*.  
    >    The Personal Information page appears.
