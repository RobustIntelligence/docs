Average Confidence,Model Performance,"tabular, nlp, cv","This test checks the average confidence of the model predictions between the reference and evaluation sets to see if the metric has experienced significant degradation. The ""confidence"" of a prediction for classification tasks is defined as the distance between the probability of the predicted class (defined as the argmax over the prediction vector) and 1. We average this metric across all predictions.","During production, factors like distribution shift or a change in <span>p(y|x)</span> may cause model performance to decrease significantly. Since oftentimes labels are not available in a production setting, this metric can serve as a useful proxy for model performance.","By default, this test runs if predictions are specified (no labels required).","[tabular] Binary Classification, [tabular] Multi-class Classification"
Average Thresholded Confidence,Model Performance,"tabular, nlp, cv","This test checks the average thresholded confidence (ATC) of the model predictions between the reference and evaluation sets to see if the metric has experienced significant degradation. ATC is a method for estimating accuracy of unlabeled examples taken from <a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.04234"">this paper</a>. The threshold is first computed on the reference set: we pick a confidence threshold such that the percentage of datapoints whose max predicted probability is less than the threshold is around equal to the error rate of the model (here, it is 1-accuracy) on the reference set. Then, we apply this threshold in the evaluation set: the predicted accuracy is then equal to the percentage of datapoints with max predicted probability greater than this threshold.","During production, factors like distribution shift may cause model performance to decrease significantly. Since oftentimes labels are not available in a production setting, this metric can serve as a useful proxy for model performance.","By default, this test runs if predictions/labels are specified in the reference set and predictions are specified in the eval set (no labels required).","[tabular] Binary Classification, [tabular] Multi-class Classification"
Calibration Comparison,Model Performance,"tabular, nlp, cv","This test checks that the reference and evaluation sets have sufficiently similar calibration curves as measured by the Mean Squared Error (MSE) between the two curves. The calibration curve is a line plot where the x-axis represents the average predicted probability and the y-axis is the proportion of positive predictions. The curve of the ideal calibrated model is thus a linear straight line from (0, 0) moving linearly.","Knowing how well-calibrated your model is can help you better interpret and act upon model outputs, and can even be an indicator of generalization. A greater difference between reference and evaluation curves could indicate a lack of generalizability. In addition, a change in calibration could indicate that decision-making or thresholding conducted upstream needs to change as it is behaving differently on held-out data.","By default, this test runs over the predictions and labels.",[tabular] Binary Classification

Predictive Equality (FPR),Bias and Fairness,tabular,"The false positive error rate test is also popularly referred to as as predictive equality, or equal mis-opportunity in fairness literature. This test checks whether the model performs equally well across a given subset of rows as it does across the whole dataset. The key detail displays the performance difference between the lowest performing subset and the overall population. The test first splits the dataset into various subsets depending on the quantiles of a given feature column. If the feature is categorical, the data is split based on the feature values. We then test whether the false positive rate of model predictions within a specific subset is significantly higher than the model prediction false positive rate over the entire population. ","Having different false positive rates (e.g. predictive equality) between different subgroups is an important indicator of performance bias; in general, bias is an important phenomenon in machine learning and not only contains implications for fairness and ethics, but also indicates failures in adequate feature representation and spurious correlation. Unlike demographic parity, this test permits assuming different base label rates but flags differing mistake rates between different subgroups. As an intuitive example, consider the case when the label indicates an undesirable attribute: if predicting whether a person will default on their loan, make sure that for people who didn't default, the rate at which the model incorrectly predicts positive is similar for group A and B. ","By default, false positive rate is computed over all predictions/labels. Note that we round predictions to 0/1 to compute false positive rate.","[tabular] Binary Classification, [tabular] Ranking"
Discrimination By Proxy,Bias and Fairness,tabular,"This test checks whether any feature is a proxy for a protected feature. It runs over categorical features, using mutual information as a measure of similarity with a protected feature. Mutual information measures any dependencies between two variables.","A common strategy to try to ensure a model is not biased is to remove protected features from the training data entirely so the model cannot learn over them. However, if other features are highly dependent on those features, that could lead to the model effectively still training over those features by proxy.","By default, this test is run over all categorical protected columns.","[tabular] Regression, [tabular] Binary Classification, [tabular] Ranking, [tabular] Multi-class Classification"
