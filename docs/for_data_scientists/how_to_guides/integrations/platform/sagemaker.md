# RIME 🤝 SageMaker

This walkthrough will cover how to integrate AI Stress Testing and the AI Firewall 
into your workflow on the SageMaker platform. For a concise example of the `model.py` file,
please reference the [SageMaker Model Provider](sagemaker.md) doc.

This assumes you have already set up your
SageMaker account and have a notebook instance running.

First, download the [SageMaker Walkthrough Notebook here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VoTANkIvugMGs69Md4_7yEWE5K1wk6XJ/edit). 
Then, from the [SageMaker console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker), navigate to your new notebook instance and either open
Jupyter and press "Upload" in the toolbar, or open JupyterLab and upload the notebook through
the File Browser on the left.


Once the notebook file has been imported, follow the instructions to see how AI Stress Testing
can enhance your existing model development process on SageMaker and how the AI Firewall
can monitor and secure your models once they are deployed.
