# Summary Tests
## Drift
Test for differences in the distribution of the reference dataset versus the         evaluation dataset. If predictions and labels are provided, measure the         performance degradation caused by shifting data as well as drift in         predictions and labels themselves.        <br>        <br>        Labels and predictions are not required but they improve results.
## Abnormal Inputs
Check the evaluation dataset for abnormal values commonly encountered in         production. If model predictions are provided, test if the observed abnormal          values cause a degradation in your modelâ€™s performance.        <br>        <br>        Labels and predictions are not required but they improve results.
## Subset Performance
Test that your model performs equally well across different subsets of the         evaluation dataset.        <br>        <br>        Predictions are required. Labels are required for most tests.
## Transformations
Test your model's invariance to different types of data transformations.        <br>        <br>        Model is required. Labels are not required but they improve results.
## Model Performance
Test that your model performs well on the evaluation dataset and         is not degrading in performance.        <br>        <br>        Predictions are required. Labels are required for exact performance metrics,        otherwise approximate performance metrics will be used.
## Adversarial
Test the robustness of your model by measuring the maximum         difference in model predictions that can be caused by small perturbations to         the input.        <br>        <br>        Model is required.
## Data Cleanliness
Test for data reliability by checking that your data is consistent and complete.
## Subset Performance Degradation
Test that your model's performance on different subsets of the data has not         degraded.        <br>        <br>        Predictions are required. Labels are required for most tests.
