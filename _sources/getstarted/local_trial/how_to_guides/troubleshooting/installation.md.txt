# Debugging the Installation

1. **I'm seeing errors when trying to download the Python Package.**

    If the error messages resemble the one below, you may need to add [packagecloud.io](https://packagecloud.io) as a trusted host:
    ```
    certificate verify failed: unable to get local issuer certificate ...
    ```

    To do so, simply re-run the `pip install` command with an extra flag:
    ```
    pip install --trusted-host packagecloud.io -r rime_requirements.txt
    ```
