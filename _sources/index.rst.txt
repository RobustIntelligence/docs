Welcome to RIME!
================================

RIME enables comprehensive testing of data and model performance in the crucial pre-development and post-development stages of the life cycle.

The RIME documentation is broken up into four sections.
First, we have a **Getting Started** section allowing newcomers to easily get started, covering installation and simple tutorials.
Next, we have **How-To Guides**, demonstrating how to use RIME to solve specific problems.
After that, we have a **Reference** section covering our SDK and APIs, along with detailed information about how to configure RIME.
Finally, we have an **Explanation** section which explains key RIME concepts.
