# API Access Tokens 

* To authenticate and use the RIME Python SDK or REST APIs, users need to generate 
an API token from the "API Access Tokens" page under "Workspace Settings". You can 
see how in the below image.
* API Access Tokens are tied to a specific workspace. For more information on workspaces, see [Workspaces](/for_admins/how_to_guides/workspaces.md). 
* API Access Tokens are meant to be assigned to individual users.
* Admins can manage the API tokens for all users in a workspace.
* All existing API tokens are assigned to "Workspace 1" and assigned to the default admin.
* Each organization can have up to a maximum of 200 API tokens across all workspaces.
* The API token will expire 270 days after creation.
