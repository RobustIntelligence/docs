    "In this walkthrough, we'll run AI Stress Testing and AI Continuous Testing on public NYC Taxi and Limousine Commission data (https://www1.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page) to demonstrate how RIME can be used with regression models. This data consists of information such as the pickup and dropoff locations, pickup and dropoff times, fare amounts and the number of passengers for every taxi trip that happens in New York City. We'll be predicting the duration of each trip given a bunch of other information about the trip.\n",

    "As you might imagine, the COVID-19 pandemic caused a significant change in the number and nature of the taxi rides that occur in New York City. We've included data from 2018 to 2021 for this walkthrough to demonstrate how AI Continuous Testing can help you identify and understand such distribution drifts.\n"
