<th class="stub"><p>Model Performance</p></th>
<td><p>This test checks the average confidence of the model predictions between the reference and evaluation sets to see if the metric has experienced significant degradation. The “confidence” of a prediction for classification tasks is defined as the distance between the probability of the predicted class (defined as the argmax over the prediction vector) and 1. We average this metric across all predictions.</p>
<p>Policies: NIST Map 1.5</p>
</td>
<td><p>During production, factors like distribution shift or a change in p(y|x) may cause model performance to decrease significantly. Since oftentimes labels are not available in a production setting, this metric can serve as a useful proxy for model performance.</p></td>

</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><th class="stub"><p>Average Thresholded Confidence</p></th>
<th class="stub"><p>Model Performance</p></th>
<td><p>This test checks the average thresholded confidence (ATC) of the model predictions between the reference and evaluation sets to see if the metric has experienced significant degradation. ATC is a method for estimating accuracy of unlabeled examples taken from [this paper](<a class="reference external" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.04234">https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.04234</a>). The threshold is first computed on the reference set: we pick a confidence threshold such that the percentage of datapoints whose max predicted probability is less than the threshold is around equal to the error rate of the model (here, it is 1-accuracy) on the reference set. Then, we apply this threshold in the evaluation set: the predicted accuracy is then equal to the percentage of datapoints with max predicted probability greater than this threshold.</p>

<td><p>During production, factors like distribution shift may cause model performance to decrease significantly. Since oftentimes labels are not available in a production setting, this metric can serve as a useful proxy for model performance.</p></td>

</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><th class="stub"><p>Calibration Comparison</p></th>
<th class="stub"><p>Model Performance</p></th>
<td><p>This test checks that the reference and evaluation sets have sufficiently similar calibration curves as measured by the Mean Squared Error (MSE) between the two curves. The calibration curve is a line plot where the x-axis represents the average predicted probability and the y-axis is the proportion of positive predictions. The curve of the ideal calibrated model is thus a linear straight line from (0, 0) moving linearly.</p>
<p>Policies: NIST Map 1.5</p>
</td>
<td><p>Knowing how well-calibrated your model is can help you better interpret and act upon model outputs, and can even be an indicator of generalization. A greater difference between reference and evaluation curves could indicate a lack of generalizability. In addition, a change in calibration could indicate that decision-making or thresholding conducted upstream needs to change as it is behaving differently on held-out data.</p></td>

<td><p>The false positive error rate test is also popularly referred to as predictive equality, or equal mis-opportunity in fairness literature. This test checks whether the model performs equally well across a given subset of rows as it does across the whole dataset. The key detail displays the performance difference between the lowest performing subset and the overall population. The test first splits the dataset into various subsets depending on the quantiles of a given feature column. If the feature is categorical, the data is split based on the feature values.

<td><p>Having different Accuracy between different subgroups is an important indicator of performance bias; in general, bias is an important phenomenon in machine learning and not only contains implications for and ethics, but also indicates failures in adequate feature representation and fairness spurious correlation. Accuracy can be thought of as a ‘weaker’ metric of model bias compared to measuring false positive rate (predictive equality) or false negative rate (equal opportunity). This is because we can have similar accuracy between group A and group B; yet group A actually has higher false positive rate, while group B has higher false negative rate (e.g. we reject qualified applicants in group A but accept non-qualified applicants in group B). Nevertheless, accuracy is a standard metric used during evaluation and should be considered as part of performance bias testing.</p></td>

<td><p>This test scans the model output on each row in the dataset to check if it contains any private entities such as credit card or social security numbers, or other sensitive personal details. This test uses a combination of pattern recognition rules and machine learning to detect sensitive information.</p></td>
<td><p>Generative language foundation models are trained on massive volumes of content scraped from the web, and many LLM applications involve connecting the model with external data sources like web search or database query. Both the training and contextual data may not be properly de-identified and thus introduce the risk of the model outputting private data in production. It is important to verify that your model is not revealing sensitive information to users.</p></td>

<th class="stub"><p>Evasion Attack Detection</p></th>
<td><p>This test uses an external language model to check if the text inputs of the user cause the model to reveal its initial prompt. It does this by providing a phony prompt containing a canary token and checking to see if this token appears in the model output.</p></td>
<td><p>The prompt template used for a model is often regarded as intellectual property as it is a major component of how the model application functions. If the prompt is leaked, an attacker may be able to use the prompt to create a competing product or at least circumvent needing to use the original application. It also could contain sensitive information that should not be leaked. Additionally, for attackers looking to construct more dangerous exploits, learning the model’s prompt can provide significant clues to help them craft other prompt injection attacks.</p></td>
