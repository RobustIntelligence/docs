<tr class="row-even"><td><p>Average Confidence</p></td>
<td><p>Model Performance</p></td>
<td><p>This test checks the average confidence of the model predictions between the reference and evaluation sets to see if the metric has experienced significant degradation. The “confidence” of a prediction for classification tasks is defined as the distance between the probability of the predicted class (defined as the argmax over the prediction vector) and 1. We average this metric across all predictions.</p></td>
<td><p>During production, factors like distribution shift or a change in &lt;span&gt;p(y|x)&lt;/span&gt; may cause model performance to decrease significantly. Since oftentimes labels are not available in a production setting, this metric can serve as a useful proxy for model performance.</p></td>
<td><p>By default, this test runs if predictions are specified (no labels required).</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td><p>Average Thresholded Confidence</p></td>
<td><p>Model Performance</p></td>
<td><p>This test checks the average thresholded confidence (ATC) of the model predictions between the reference and evaluation sets to see if the metric has experienced significant degradation. ATC is a method for estimating accuracy of unlabeled examples taken from &lt;a href=”<a class="reference external" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.04234">https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.04234</a>”&gt;this paper&lt;/a&gt;. The threshold is first computed on the reference set: we pick a confidence threshold such that the percentage of datapoints whose max predicted probability is less than the threshold is around equal to the error rate of the model (here, it is 1-accuracy) on the reference set. Then, we apply this threshold in the evaluation set: the predicted accuracy is then equal to the percentage of datapoints with max predicted probability greater than this threshold.</p></td>
<td><p>During production, factors like distribution shift may cause model performance to decrease significantly. Since oftentimes labels are not available in a production setting, this metric can serve as a useful proxy for model performance.</p></td>
<td><p>By default, this test runs if predictions/labels are specified in the reference set and predictions are specified in the eval set (no labels required).</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td><p>Calibration Comparison</p></td>
<td><p>Model Performance</p></td>
<td><p>This test checks that the reference and evaluation sets have sufficiently similar calibration curves as measured by the Mean Squared Error (MSE) between the two curves. The calibration curve is a line plot where the x-axis represents the average predicted probability and the y-axis is the proportion of positive predictions. The curve of the ideal calibrated model is thus a linear straight line from (0, 0) moving linearly.</p></td>
<td><p>Knowing how well-calibrated your model is can help you better interpret and act upon model outputs, and can even be an indicator of generalization. A greater difference between reference and evaluation curves could indicate a lack of generalizability. In addition, a change in calibration could indicate that decision-making or thresholding conducted upstream needs to change as it is behaving differently on held-out data.</p></td>

Model Development, Implementation and Use: “An integral part of model development is testing, in which the various components of a model and its overall functioning are evaluated to determine whether the model is performing as intended. Model testing includes checking the model’s accuracy, demonstrating that the model is robust and stable, assessing potential limitations, and evaluating the model’s behavior over a range of input values. It should also assess the impact of assumptions and identify situations where the model performs poorly or becomes unreliable.” In addition our entire test suite helps fulfill the requirements specified under Section V. Model Validation: “Documentation and testing should convey an understanding of model limitations and assumptions,” which is a key outcome of the entire test suite. Our Continuous Testing capabilities allow for ongoing monitoring, which is another key part of SR 11-7’s Section V. Model Validation: “The second core element of the validation process is ongoing monitoring. Such monitoring confirms that the model is appropriately implemented and is being used and is performing as intended.</div>
<div class="line">Ongoing monitoring is essential to evaluate whether changes in products, exposures, activities, clients, or market conditions necessitate adjustment, redevelopment, or replacement of the model and to verify that any extension of the model beyond its original scope is valid.” Further, SR 11-7 requires the evaluation of a model’s conceptual soundness in Section V.

<div class="line">The EU AI Act proposes that systems must have risk management systems in place (as seen in Chapter 2, Requirements for High-Risk AI systems) throughout their entire lifecycle (must be able to identify known and foreseeable risks associated with the AI system, estimate and evaluate risks that “may emerge” when the system is “used in accordance with its intended purpose and under conditions of reasonably foreseeable misuse”), including risk management measures. Our full stress testing suite fulfills this all-encompassing risk management system requirement. In addition, Chapter 2 of the Act requires human oversight throughout the AI lifecycle to “facilitate the respect of other fundamental rights by minimising the risk of erroneous or biased AI-assisted decisions in critical areas such as education and training, employment, important services, law enforcement and the judiciary,” which the RI platform allows for by having a user-friendly UI and notifications and alerts for any updates on model testing.
