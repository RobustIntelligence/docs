<p>The Robust Intelligence (RI) Platform secures your machine learning pipeline so you can focus on building better ML models for your business needs.</p>
<section id="the-ri-platform">
<h2>The RI Platform<a class="headerlink" href="#the-ri-platform" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>The RI Platform operates at three stages of the ML lifecycle.</p>
<p>During model development, <strong>AI Stress Testing</strong> measures the robustness of your model by running dozens of pre-configured tests, each of which checks the model’s vulnerability to a specific form of potential failure in production. After production deployment and before inference, <strong>AI Firewall</strong> protects your model from such critical errors in real-time by flagging or blocking aberrant data from entering your ML system. After inference, <strong>AI Continuous Testing</strong> monitors your model and alerts on issues such as data drift and performance degradation. When things go wrong, it also offers automated root cause analysis of the underlying driver of performance change.</p>

<section id="why-use-the-ri-platform">
<h2>Why use the RI Platform?<a class="headerlink" href="#why-use-the-ri-platform" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>In modern engineering organizations, data scientists and machine learning engineers typically spend the majority of their effort on the development stage of the model life cycle, which encompasses data ingestion and cleaning, feature extraction, and model training. During this stage, models are primarily evaluated based on their performance on some clean, held-out test set.</p>
<p>While such metrics might be sufficient for understanding model performance in controlled development environments, deploying models into production introduces a whole new set of challenges and failure modes that are often overlooked. Once a model is deployed, data scientists no longer have complete control over how a model is instantiated, how data is passed into the model, nor do they have any oversight over data pipelines in which the model is integrated. Even when the model is used correctly, the real world can change, and issues like distributional shifts in production data may silently degrade model performance.</p>
</section>
<section id="key-features">
<h2>Key Features<a class="headerlink" href="#key-features" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>The RI Platform addresses these risks with four core products:</p>
<section id="ai-stress-testing">
<h3>AI Stress Testing<a class="headerlink" href="#ai-stress-testing" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>AI Stress Testing is a set of tests that measure the robustness of your ML deployment by computing an aggregate severity score across all tests. The severity score is a measure of the magnitude of the identified failure mode specific to each test. It is a combination of the impact the failure has on model performance (<strong>Performance Change</strong> or <strong>Prediction Change</strong>) and the prevalence of the failure mode in the reference set (<strong>Abnormal Inputs</strong> or <strong>Drift Statistic</strong>). By running hundreds of these unit tests and simulations across both your model and associated reference and evaluation datasets, the RI Platform identifies implicit assumptions and failure modes of the ML deployment.</p>
<p>AI Stress Testing allows you to test your data and model before deployment. We recommend providing a model and labels when running AI Stress Testing to leverage the platform’s full potential; however, it is not required. You can run the RI Platform in various modes.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Model</strong>: Providing access to the model allows for testing the model behavior under different circumstances. In these tests, we perturb model inputs, provide them to the model, and examine the model behavior to uncover its vulnerabilities.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Predictions</strong>: Providing predictions for the data can speed up the RI Platform and allows us to test your model even if you don’t provide a model interface. We use sophisticated statistical algorithms to run most of the same tests as when we have direct model access to uncover vulnerabilities within your model and approximate the impact of each vulnerability. If you provide neither a model nor predictions, the RI Platform will still run data quality and data distribution shift tests.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Labels</strong>: Providing labels allows for testing model performance under different circumstances. If you do not provide labels, the RI Platform will still run data quality tests, data distribution tests, and prediction distribution tests (if possible).</p></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="ai-firewall">
<h3>AI Firewall<a class="headerlink" href="#ai-firewall" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>AI Firewall protects your model from bad predictions before model inference. Firewall operates at the data point level. It can flag or block aberrant data points in realtime, and the AI Firewall is automatically configured from the results of stress testing. The end result is that the user gets a custom AI Firewall that protects against the unique forms of model failure to which a given model is susceptible. Firewall can be deployed with a single line of code directly in the inference pipeline of your ML model, wherein it logs, analyzes, and/or acts upon (flag, block, impute) aberrant data points in realtime.</p>
</section>
<section id="ai-continuous-testing">
<h3>AI Continuous Testing<a class="headerlink" href="#ai-continuous-testing" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>AI Continuous Testing enables the user to monitor their ML model after inference. As suggested by the name, this view uses the same Stress Testing framework applied continually across time. Data drift will inevitably occur once a model is deployed in production. Continuous tests help answer both the what and the why of changing data. It not only detects issues as they happen but also alerts you regarding the issues and provides insight into their root causes - shortening the time to resolution. Continuous Testing can be set up by passively logging and analyzing predictions by uploading prediction logs after model inference. These can be automated to run at regular intervals.</p>
</section>
<section id="ai-compliance-management">
<h3>AI Compliance Management<a class="headerlink" href="#ai-compliance-management" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>AI Compliance Management allows the user to download auto-generated model cards for internal and external documentation needs. This incorporates results from the AI Stress Testing suite (including a suite of bias and fairness tests) that measure a model’s production readiness. These reports help companies comply with AI regulatory standards.</p>
</section>
<section id="governance-dashboard">
<h3>Governance Dashboard<a class="headerlink" href="#governance-dashboard" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>A single pane of glass provides visibility into all models in production, providing model health status and the ability to track models to any custom metric. The Governance dashboard is behind a feature flag. Request enabling of this feature directly from Robust Intelligence.</p>

ATC is a method for estimating accuracy of unlabeled examples taken from &lt;a href=”<a class="reference external" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.04234">https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.04234</a>”&gt;this paper&lt;/a&gt;. The threshold is first computed on the reference set: we pick a confidence threshold such that the percentage of datapoints whose max predicted probability is less than the threshold is around equal to the error rate of the model (here, it is 1-accuracy) on the reference set. Then, we apply this threshold in the evaluation set: the predicted accuracy is then equal to the percentage of datapoints with max predicted probability greater than this threshold.</p></td>
<td><p>During production, factors like distribution shift may cause model performance to decrease significantly. Since oftentimes labels are not available in a production setting, this metric can serve as a useful proxy for model performance.</p></td>

<td><p>This test checks that the reference and evaluation sets have sufficiently similar calibration curves as measured by the Mean Squared Error (MSE) between the two curves. The calibration curve is a line plot where the x-axis represents the average predicted probability and the y-axis is the proportion of positive predictions. The curve of the ideal calibrated model is thus a linear straight line from (0, 0) moving linearly.</p></td>
<td><p>Knowing how well-calibrated your model is can help you better interpret and act upon model outputs, and can even be an indicator of generalization. A greater difference between reference and evaluation curves could indicate a lack of generalizability. In addition, a change in calibration could indicate that decision-making or thresholding conducted upstream needs to change as it is behaving differently on held-out data.</p></td>

<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line">FDA’s Good Machine Learning Practices , #2. “Good Software Engineering and Security Practices Are Implemented”: the entire stress testing suite fulfills the need to demonstrate “good software engineering practices, data quality assurance, data management, and robust cybersecurity practices” and #8 “Testing Demonstrates Device Performance during Clinically Relevant Conditions”: our entire test suite is reproducible.</div>

<div class="line"><strong>Federal Reserve Supervisory Guidance on Model Risk Management (SR 11-7)</strong>:</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line">SR 11-7 is the key piece of regulation for banking and lending institutions in the United States enforced by the Federal Reserve. Our entire stress testing suite helps fulfill the requirements SR 11-7 specifies under Section IV. Model Development, Implementation and Use: “An integral part of model development is testing, in which the various components of a model and its overall functioning are evaluated to determine whether the model is performing as intended. Model testing includes checking the model’s accuracy, demonstrating that the model is robust and stable, assessing potential limitations, and evaluating the model’s behavior over a range of input values.</div>
<div class="line">It should also assess the impact of assumptions and identify situations where the model performs poorly or becomes unreliable.” In addition our entire test suite helps fulfill the requirements specified under Section V. Model Validation: “Documentation and testing should convey an understanding of model limitations and assumptions,” which is a key outcome of the entire test suite. Our Continuous Testing capabilities allow for ongoing monitoring, which is another key part of SR 11-7’s Section V. Model Validation section: “The second core element of the validation process is ongoing monitoring. Such monitoring confirms that the model is appropriately implemented and is being used and is performing as intended. Ongoing monitoring is essential to evaluate whether changes in products, exposures, activities, clients, or market conditions necessitate adjustment, redevelopment, or replacement of the model and to verify that any extension of the model beyond its original scope is valid.” Further, SR 11-7 requires the evaluation of a model’s conceptual soundness in Section V. Model Validation: our Attacks and Transformation test categories employ sensitivity analysis tests which can “check the impact of small changes in inputs and parameter values on model outputs to make sure they fall within an expected range.”</div>

<div class="line"><strong>EU AI Act</strong>:</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line">The EU AI Act proposes that systems must have risk management systems in place (as seen in Chapter 2, Requirements for High-Risk AI systems  throughout their entire lifecycle (must be able to identify known and foreseeable risks associated with the AI system, estimate and evaluate risks that ‘may merge’ when the system is ‘used in accordance with its intended purpose and under conditions of reasonably foreseeable misuse’, include risk management measures. Our full stress testing suite fulfills this all-encompassing risk management system requirement. In addition, Chapter 2 of the Act requires human oversight throughout the AI lifecycle to “facilitate the respect of other fundamental rights by minimising the risk of erroneous or biased AI-assisted decisions in critical areas such as education and training, employment, important services, law enforcement and the judiciary,” which the RI platform allows for by having a user-friendly UI and notifications and alerts for any updates on model testing. Model cards also allow for logging and documentation of model testing results, which can be used for reporting and tracking.</div>
