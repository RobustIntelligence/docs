<section id="universal-prefix-attack">
<h3>Universal Prefix Attack<a class="headerlink" href="#universal-prefix-attack" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>This test measures the robustness of your model to 'universal' adversarial prefix injections. It does this by sampling a batch of inputs, and searching over the model vocabulary to find a prefix that is nonsensical to a reader but that, when prepended to the batch of inputs, will cause the model to output a different prediction. See the paper  "Universal Adversarial Triggers for Attacking and Analyzing NLP" by Wallace, Feng, Kandpal, et al. (https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.07125) for more details.</p><p><b>Why it matters:</b> Malicious actors can perturb natural language input sequences to  alter model behavior in unexpected ways. 'Universal triggers'  pose a particularly large threat since they easily transfer between models and data points to permit an adversary to make large-scale, cost-efficient attacks. It is important that your NLP models are robust to such threat vectors.</p><p><b>Configuration:</b> By default, this test runs when the 'Adversarial' category is specified.</p><p><b>Example:</b> Given a target class of 0, this test selects a batch of inputs for which the model predicts a different class (e.g., 1). It then searches for an adversarial prefix that maximizes the probability assigned to the target class. The severity of this test is based on the difference in the average probability assigned to the target class before and after the prefix is prepended to the batch. For instance, given two inputs "I am happy!" and "I like ice cream!", the attack finds an example prefix, e.g., "the why y could", and measures the new probability assigned by the model to the target class for inputs "the why y could I am happy!" and "the why y could I like ice cream!".</p>

<section id="abnormal-inputs">
<h2>Abnormal Inputs<a class="headerlink" href="#abnormal-inputs" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>
<section id="numeric-outliers">
<h3>Numeric Outliers<a class="headerlink" href="#numeric-outliers" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>This test measures the number of failing rows in your data with outliers and their impact on the model. Outliers are values which may not necessarily be outside of an allowed range for a feature, but are extreme values that are unusual and may be indicative of abnormality. The model impact is the difference in model performance between passing and failing rows with outliers. If labels are not provided, prediction change is used instead of model performance change.</p><p><b>Why it matters:</b> Outliers can be a sign of corrupted or otherwise erroneous data, and can degrade model performance if used in the training data, or lead to unexpected behaviour if input at inference time.</p><p><b>Configuration:</b> By default this test is run over each numeric feature that is neither unique nor ascending.</p><p><b>Example:</b> Suppose there is a feature <span>age</span> for which in the reference set the values <span>103</span> and <span>114</span> each appear once but every other value (with substantial sample size) is contained within the range <span>[0, 97]</span>. Then we would infer a lower outlier threshold of <span>0</span> and an upper outlier threshold of <span>97</span>. This test raises a warning if we observe any values in the evaluation set outside these thresholds or if model performance decreases on observed datapoints with outliers.</p>

<section id="unseen-categorical">
<h3>Unseen Categorical<a class="headerlink" href="#unseen-categorical" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>This test measures the number of failing rows in your data with unseen categorical values and their impact on the model. The model impact is the difference in model performance between passing and failing rows with unseen categorical values. If labels are not provided, prediction change is used instead of model performance change.</p><p><b>Why it matters:</b> Unseen categorical values are a common failure point in machine learning systems; since these models are trained over a reference set, they may yield uninterpretable or undefined behavior when interacting with an unseen categorical value. In addition, such errors may expose gaps or errors in data collection.</p><p><b>Configuration:</b> By default, this test runs over all categorical features.</p><p><b>Example:</b> Say that the feature <span>Animal</span> contains the values <span>['Cat', 'Dog']</span> from the reference set. This test raises a warning if we observe any unseen values in the evaluation set such as <span>'Mouse'</span> that causes a significant change in model performance. If labels/predictions are provided in the run, then a severity would be raised if the Average Prediction changed by 0.03. If labels/predictions were not provided but <span>'Mouse'</span> appeared in 3% of the evaluation dataset, an severity would be raised due to the significant increase in presence of an unseen feature.</p>

<p>F1 is a holistic measure of both precision and recall. When transitioning to the multiclass setting we can use macro F1 which computes the F1 of each class and averages them. This test checks whether the model performs equally well across a given subset of rows as it does across the whole dataset.

The test first splits the dataset into various subsets depending on the quantiles of a given feature column. If the feature is categorical, the data is split based on the feature values.

Unlike demographic parity, this test permits assuming different base label rates but flags differing mistake rates between different subgroups. Note that positive predictive parity does not necessarily indicate equal opportunity or predictive equality: as a hypothetical example, imagine that a loan qualification classifier flags 100 entries for group A and 100 entries for group B, each with a precision of 100%, but there are 100 actual qualified entries in group A and 9000 in group B.

Accuracy can be thought of as a 'weaker' metric of model bias compared to measuring false positive rate (predictive equality) or false negative rate (equal opportunity). This is because we can have similar accuracy between group A and group B; yet group A actually has higher false positive rate, while group B has higher false negative rate (e.g. we reject qualified applicants in group A but accept non-qualified applicants in group B). Nevertheless, accuracy is a standard metric used during evaluation and should be considered as part of performance bias testing.</p><p><b>Configuration:</b> By default, accuracy is computed over all predictions/labels.

ATC is a method for estimating accuracy of unlabeled examples taken from <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.04234">this paper</a>. The threshold is first computed on the reference set: we pick a confidence threshold such that the percentage of datapoints whose max predicted probability is less than the threshold is around equal to the error rate of the model (here, it is 1-accuracy) on the reference set.

<h3>Label Flipping Detection (Exact Match)<a class="headerlink" href="#label-flipping-detection-exact-match" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>This test detects corrupted data points in the evaluation dataset. It does this by checking for input text strings in the evaluation set that are also present in the reference set, but with a different label. This test assumes that the reference set is clean, trusted data and the evaluation set is potentially corrupted.</p><p><b>Why it matters:</b> Malicious actors can tamper with data pipelines by sending mislabeled data points to confuse your model. Detecting poisoning attacks before they affect your model is critical to ensuring model security.</p><p><b>Configuration:</b> By default, this test runs when the "Data Poisoning Detection" test category is selected.</p><p><b>Example:</b> Suppose there was an identical input text string in both datasets, with label <span>0</span> in the reference set and label <span>1</span> in the evaluation set. This test would flag the sample in the evaluation set as being corrupted.</p>
