<h3>Numeric Outliers<a class="headerlink" href="#numeric-outliers" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>This test measures the number of failing rows in your data with outliers and their impact on the model. Outliers are values which may not necessarily be outside of an allowed range for a feature, but are extreme values that are unusual and may be indicative of abnormality. The model impact is the difference in model performance between passing and failing rows with outliers. If labels are not provided, prediction change is used instead of model performance change.</p><p><b>Why it matters:</b> Outliers can be a sign of corrupted or otherwise erroneous data, and can degrade model performance if used in the training data, or lead to unexpected behaviour if input at inference time.</p><p><b>Configuration:</b> By default this test is run over each numeric feature that is neither unique nor ascending.</p><p><b>Example:</b> Suppose there is a feature <span>age</span> for which in the reference set the values <span>103</span> and <span>114</span> each appear once but every other value (with substantial sample size) is contained within the range <span>[0, 97]</span>. Then we would infer a lower outlier threshold of <span>0</span> and an upper outlier threshold of <span>97</span>. This test raises a warning if we observe any values in the evaluation set outside these thresholds or if model performance decreases on observed datapoints with outliers.</p>

<h3>Unseen Categorical<a class="headerlink" href="#unseen-categorical" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>This test measures the number of failing rows in your data with unseen categorical values and their impact on the model. The model impact is the difference in model performance between passing and failing rows with unseen categorical values. If labels are not provided, prediction change is used instead of model performance change.</p><p><b>Why it matters:</b> Unseen categorical values are a common failure point in machine learning systems; since these models are trained over a reference set, they may yield uninterpretable or undefined behavior when interacting with an unseen categorical value. In addition, such errors may expose gaps or errors in data collection.</p><p><b>Configuration:</b> By default, this test runs over all categorical features.</p><p><b>Example:</b> Say that the feature <span>Animal</span> contains the values <span>['Cat', 'Dog']</span> from the reference set. This test raises a warning if we observe any unseen values in the evaluation set such as <span>'Mouse'</span> that causes a significant change in model performance. If labels/predictions are provided in the run, then a severity would be raised if the Average Prediction changed by 0.03. If labels/predictions were not provided but <span>'Mouse'</span> appeared in 3% of the evaluation dataset, an severity would be raised due to the significant increase in presence of an unseen feature.</p>

<section id="rare-categories">
<h3>Rare Categories<a class="headerlink" href="#rare-categories" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>This test measures the severity of passing to the model data points whose features contain rarely observed categories (relative to the reference set). The severity is a function of the impact of these values on the model, as well as the presence of these values in the data. The model impact is the difference in model performance between passing and failing rows with rarely observed categorical values. If labels are not provided, prediction change is used instead of model performance change. The number of failing rows refers to the number of times rarely observed categorical values are observed in the evaluation set.</p><p><b>Why it matters:</b> Rare categories are a common failure point in machine learning systems because less data often means worse performance. In addition, this may expose gaps or errors in data collection.</p><p><b>Configuration:</b> By default, this test runs over all categorical features. A category is considered rare if it occurs fewer than <span>min_num_occurrences</span> times, or if it occurs less than <span>min_pct_occurrences</span> of the time. If neither of these values are specified, the rate of appearance below which a category is considered rare is <span>min_ratio_rel_uniform</span> divided by the number of classes.</p><p><b>Example:</b> Say that the feature <span>AgeGroup</span> takes on the value <span>0-18</span> twice while taking on the value <span>35-55</span> a total of <span>98</span> times. If the <span>min_num_occurences</span> is <span>5</span> and the <span>min_pct_occurrences</span> is <span>0.03</span> then the test will flag the value <span>0-18</span> as a rare category.</p>

<section id="out-of-range">
<h3>Out of Range<a class="headerlink" href="#out-of-range" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>This test measures the number of failing rows in your data with values outside the inferred range of allowed values and their impact on the model. The model impact is the difference in model performance between passing and failing rows with values outside the inferred range of allowed values. If labels are not provided, prediction change is used instead of model performance change.</p><p><b>Why it matters:</b> In production, the model may encounter corrupted or manipulated out of range values. It is important that the model is robust to such extremities.</p><p><b>Configuration:</b> By default, this test runs over all numeric features.</p><p><b>Example:</b> In the reference set, the <span>Age</span> feature has a range of <span>[0, 121]</span>. This test raises a warning if we observe values outside of this range in the evaluation set (eg. <span>150, 200</span>) or if model performance decreases on observed datapoints outside of this range.</p>

<section id="required-characters">
<h3>Required Characters<a class="headerlink" href="#required-characters" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>This test measures the number of failing rows in your data with strings without any required characters and their impact on the model. The model impact is the difference in model performance between passing and failing rows with strings without any required characters. If labels are not provided, prediction change is used instead of model performance change.</p><p><b>Why it matters:</b> A feature may require specific characters. However, errors in the data pipeline may allow invalid data points that lack these required characters to pass. Failing to catch such errors may lead to noisier training data or noisier predictions during inference, which can degrade model metrics.</p><p><b>Configuration:</b> By default, this test runs over all string features that are inferred to have required characters.</p><p><b>Example:</b> Say that the feature <span>email</span> requires the character <span>@</span>. This test raises a warning if we observe any values in the evaluation set where the character is missing.</p>
</section>
<section id="inconsistencies">
<h3>Inconsistencies<a class="headerlink" href="#inconsistencies" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>This test measures the severity of passing to the model data points whose values are inconsistent (as inferred from the reference set). The severity is a function of the impact of these values on the model, as well as the presence of these values in the data. The model impact is the difference in model performance between passing and failing rows with data containing inconsistent feature values. If labels are not provided, prediction change is used instead of model performance change. The number of failing rows refers to the number of times data containing inconsistent feature values are observed in the evaluation set.</p><p><b>Why it matters:</b> Inconsistent values might be the result of malicious actors manipulating the data or errors in the data pipeline. Thus, it is important to be aware of inconsistent values to identify sources of manipulations or errors.</p><p><b>Configuration:</b> By default, this test runs on pairs of categorical features whose correlations exceed some minimum threshold. The default threshold for the frequency ratio below which values are considered to be inconsistent is <span>0.02</span>.</p><p><b>Example:</b> Suppose we have a feature <span>country</span> that takes on value <span>"US"</span> with frequency <span>0.5</span>, and a feature <span>time_zone</span> that takes on value <span>"Central European Time"</span> with frequency <span>0.2</span>. Then if these values appear together with frequency less than <span>0.5 * 0.2 * 0.02 = 0.002 </span>, in the reference set, rows in which these values do appear together are inconsistencies.</p>
</section>
<section id="capitalization">
<h3>Capitalization<a class="headerlink" href="#capitalization" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>This test measures the number of failing rows in your data with different types of capitalization and their impact on the model. The model impact is the difference in model performance between passing and failing rows with different types of capitalization. If labels are not provided, prediction change is used instead of model performance change.</p><p><b>Why it matters:</b> In production, models can come across the same value with different capitalizations, making it important to explicitly check that your model is invariant to such differences.</p><p><b>Configuration:</b> By default, this test runs over all categorical features.</p><p><b>Example:</b> Suppose we had a column that corresponded to country code. For a specific row, let's say the observed value in the reference set was <span>USA</span>. This test raises a warning if we observe a similar value in the evaluation set with case changes, e.g. <span>uSa</span> or if model performance decreases on observed datapoints with case changes.</p>
</section>
<section id="empty-string">
<h3>Empty String<a class="headerlink" href="#empty-string" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>This test measures the number of failing rows in your data with empty string values instead of null values and their impact on the model. The model impact is the difference in model performance between passing and failing rows with empty string values instead of null values. If labels are not provided, prediction change is used instead of model performance change.</p><p><b>Why it matters:</b> In production, the model may encounter corrupted or manipulated string values. Null values and empty strings are often expected to be treated the same, but the model might not treat them that way. It is important that the model is robust to such extremities.</p><p><b>Configuration:</b> By default, this test runs over all string features with null values.</p><p><b>Example:</b> In the reference set, the <span>Name</span> feature contains nulls. This test raises a warning if we observe any empty string in the <span>Name</span> feature or if these values decrease model performance.</p>
</section>
<section id="embedding-anomalies">
<h3>Embedding Anomalies<a class="headerlink" href="#embedding-anomalies" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>This test measures the number of failing rows in your data with anomalous embeddings and their impact on the model. The model impact is the difference in model performance between passing and failing rows with anomalous embeddings. If labels are not provided, prediction change is used instead of model performance change.</p><p><b>Why it matters:</b> In production, the presence of anomalous embeddings can indicate breaks in upstream data pipelines, poor model generalization, or other issues.</p><p><b>Configuration:</b> By default, this test runs over all configured embeddings.</p><p><b>Example:</b> Say that the 'user_id' embedding is two-dimensional and has a mean at the origin and a covariance matrix of [[1, 0], [0, 1]] in the reference set. This test will flag any embeddings in the test set that are distant from the reference distribution using the Mahalanobis distance.</p>

<section id="unseen-unigram">
<h3>Unseen Unigram<a class="headerlink" href="#unseen-unigram" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>This test measures the number of failing rows in your data with unseen unigrams and their impact on the model. The model impact is the difference in model performance between passing and failing rows with unseen unigrams. If labels are not provided, prediction change is used instead of model performance change.</p><p><b>Why it matters:</b> Unseen unigrams are a common failure point in machine learning systems; since these models are trained over a reference set, they may yield uninterpretable or undefined behavior when interacting with an unseen unigram. In addition, such errors may expose gaps or errors in data collection.</p><p><b>Configuration:</b> By default, this test is run over every data point.</p><p><b>Example:</b> Say that there is a text field with value <span>James went to his casa</span> and the unigram <span>casa</span> was not seen in the reference set. This test would raise a warning flagging that datapoint, with the severity depending on how bad the model performed on that datapoint.</p>

<section id="correlation-drift-feature-to-feature">
<h3>Correlation Drift (Feature-to-Feature)<a class="headerlink" href="#correlation-drift-feature-to-feature" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>This test measures the severity of feature-feature correlation drift from the reference to the evaluation set for a given pair of features. The severity is a function of the correlation drift in the data. The key detail is the difference in correlation scores between the reference and evaluation sets, along with an associated p-value.

<h3>Average Confidence<a class="headerlink" href="#average-confidence" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>This test checks the average confidence of the model predictions between the reference and evaluation sets to see if the metric has experienced significant degradation. The "confidence" of a prediction for classification tasks is defined as the distance between the probability of the predicted class (defined as the argmax over the prediction vector) and 1. We average this metric across all predictions.</p><p><b>Why it matters:</b> During production, factors like distribution shift or a change in <span>p(y|x)</span> may cause model performance to decrease significantly. Since oftentimes labels are not available in a production setting, this metric can serve as a useful proxy for model performance.</p><p><b>Configuration:</b> By default, this test runs if predictions are specified (no labels required).</p><p><b>Example:</b> Assume that on the reference set the model obtained <span>0.85</span> average confidence but on the evaluation set without labels we predict that the model obtained <span>0.5</span> average confidence.

<h3>Average Thresholded Confidence<a class="headerlink" href="#average-thresholded-confidence" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>This test checks the average thresholded confidence (ATC) of the model predictions between the reference and evaluation sets to see if the metric has experienced significant degradation. ATC is a method for estimating accuracy of unlabeled examples taken from <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.04234">this paper</a>. The threshold is first computed on the reference set: we pick a confidence threshold such that the percentage of datapoints whose max predicted probability is less than the threshold is around equal to the error rate of the model (here, it is 1-accuracy) on the reference set. Then, we apply this threshold in the evaluation set: the predicted accuracy is then equal to the percentage of datapoints with max predicted probability greater than this threshold.</p><p><b>Why it matters:</b> During production, factors like distribution shift may cause model performance to decrease significantly. Since oftentimes labels are not available in a production setting, this metric can serve as a useful proxy for model performance.</p><p><b>Configuration:</b> By default, this test runs if predictions/labels are specified in the reference set and predictions are specified in the eval set (no labels required).</p><p><b>Example:</b> Assume that on the reference set the model obtained <span>0.85</span> accuracy but on the evaluation set, we find that only 55 percent of datapoints have max predicted probability greater than our threshold.

<section id="calibration-comparison">
<h3>Calibration Comparison<a class="headerlink" href="#calibration-comparison" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>This test checks that the reference and evaluation sets have sufficiently similar calibration curves as measured by the Mean Squared Error (MSE) between the two curves. The calibration curve is a line plot where the x-axis represents the average predicted probability and the y-axis is the proportion of positive predictions. The curve of the ideal calibrated model is thus a linear straight line from (0, 0) moving linearly.</p><p><b>Why it matters:</b> Knowing how well-calibrated your model is can help you better interpret and act upon model outputs, and can even be an indicator of generalization. A greater difference between reference and evaluation curves could indicate a lack of generalizability. In addition, a change in calibration could indicate that decision-making or thresholding conducted upstream needs to change as it is behaving differently on held-out data.</p><p><b>Configuration:</b> By default, this test runs over the predictions and labels.</p><p><b>Example:</b> Suppose the model’s task is binary classification and predicts whether or not a data point is fraudulent. If we have a reference set in which <span>1%</span> of the data points are fraudulent, but an evaluation set where <span>50%</span> are fraudulent, then our model may not be well calibrated, and the MSE difference in the curves will be large, resulting in a failing test.</p>
