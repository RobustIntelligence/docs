<h3>Average Confidence<a class="headerlink" href="#average-confidence" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>This test checks the average confidence of the model predictions between the reference and evaluation sets to see if the metric has experienced significant degradation. The "confidence" of a prediction for classification tasks is defined as the distance between the probability of the predicted class (defined as the argmax over the prediction vector) and 1. We average this metric across all predictions.</p><p><b>Why it matters:</b> During production, factors like distribution shift or a change in <span>p(y|x)</span> may cause model performance to decrease significantly. Since oftentimes labels are not available in a production setting, this metric can serve as a useful proxy for model performance.</p><p><b>Configuration:</b> By default, this test runs if predictions are specified (no labels required).</p><p><b>Example:</b> Assume that on the reference set the model obtained <span>0.85</span> average confidence but on the evaluation set without labels we predict that the model obtained <span>0.5</span> average confidence. Then this test raises a warning.</p>

<section id="average-thresholded-confidence">
<h3>Average Thresholded Confidence<a class="headerlink" href="#average-thresholded-confidence" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>This test checks the average thresholded confidence (ATC) of the model predictions between the reference and evaluation sets to see if the metric has experienced significant degradation. ATC is a method for estimating accuracy of unlabeled examples taken from <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.04234">this paper</a>. The threshold is first computed on the reference set: we pick a confidence threshold such that the percentage of datapoints whose max predicted probability is less than the threshold is around equal to the error rate of the model (here, it is 1-accuracy) on the reference set. Then, we apply this threshold in the evaluation set: the predicted accuracy is then equal to the percentage of datapoints with max predicted probability greater than this threshold.</p><p><b>Why it matters:</b> During production, factors like distribution shift may cause model performance to decrease significantly. Since oftentimes labels are not available in a production setting, this metric can serve as a useful proxy for model performance.</p><p><b>Configuration:</b> By default, this test runs if predictions/labels are specified in the reference set and predictions are specified in the eval set (no labels required).</p><p><b>Example:</b> Assume that on the reference set the model obtained <span>0.85</span> accuracy but on the evaluation set, we find that only 55 percent of datapoints have max predicted probability greater than our threshold. Then our predicted accuracy is 0.55 and this test raises a warning.</p>
</section>
<section id="calibration-comparison">
<h3>Calibration Comparison<a class="headerlink" href="#calibration-comparison" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>This test checks that the reference and evaluation sets have sufficiently similar calibration curves as measured by the Mean Squared Error (MSE) between the two curves. The calibration curve is a line plot where the x-axis represents the average predicted probability and the y-axis is the proportion of positive predictions. The curve of the ideal calibrated model is thus a linear straight line from (0, 0) moving linearly.</p><p><b>Why it matters:</b> Knowing how well-calibrated your model is can help you better interpret and act upon model outputs, and can even be an indicator of generalization. A greater difference between reference and evaluation curves could indicate a lack of generalizability. In addition, a change in calibration could indicate that decision-making or thresholding conducted upstream needs to change as it is behaving differently on held-out data.</p><p><b>Configuration:</b> By default, this test runs over the predictions and labels.</p><p><b>Example:</b> Suppose the model’s task is binary classification and predicts whether or not a data point is fraudulent. If we have a reference set in which <span>1%</span> of the data points are fraudulent, but an evaluation set where <span>50%</span> are fraudulent, then our model may not be well calibrated, and the MSE difference in the curves will be large, resulting in a failing test.</p>

The key detail displays whether the given performance metric has degraded beyond a defined threshold.</p><p><b>Why it matters:</b> During production, factors like distribution shift or a change in <span>p(y|x)</span> may cause model performance to decrease significantly.</p><p><b>Configuration:</b> By default, this test runs over the AUC metric with the below thresholds set for the absolute and degradation tests.</p><p><b>Example:</b> Assume that on the reference set the model obtained <span>0.85</span> AUC but on the evaluation set the model obtained <span>0.5</span> AUC.

<h3>Protected Feature Drift<a class="headerlink" href="#protected-feature-drift" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>This test measures the severity of passing to the model data points that have categorical features which have drifted from the distribution observed in the reference set. The severity is a function of the impact on the model, as well as the presence of drift in the data. The model impact measures how much model performance changes due to drift in the given feature.

The test compares the observed data to a model that distributes the data according to the expectation that the variables are independent. Wherever the observed data does not fit the model, the likelihood that the variables are dependent becomes stronger.</p><p><b>Why it matters:</b> A test of independence assesses whether observations consisting of measures on two variables, expressed in a contingency table, are independent of each other.

The unprotected categorical features are one-hot encoded.</p><p><b>Why it matters:</b> In a compliance setting, it may be prohibited to include certain protected features in your training data. However, unprotected features might still provide your model with information about the protected features.

We then test whether the false positive rate of model predictions within a specific subset is significantly higher than the model prediction false positive rate over the entire population. </p><p><b>Why it matters:</b> Having different false positive rates (e.g. predictive equality) between different subgroups is an important indicator of performance bias; in general, bias is an important phenomenon in machine learning and not only contains implications for fairness and ethics, but also indicates failures in adequate feature representation and spurious correlation. Unlike demographic parity, this test permits assuming different base label rates but flags differing mistake rates between different subgroups. As an intuitive example, consider the case when the label indicates an undesirable attribute: if predicting whether a person will default on their loan, make sure that for people who didn't default, the rate at which the model incorrectly predicts positive is similar for group A and B. </p><p><b>Configuration:</b> By default, false positive rate is computed over all predictions/labels. Note that we round predictions to 0/1 to compute false positive rate.</p><p><b>Example:</b> Suppose we had data with 2 features: <span>[['cat', 0.2], ['dog', 0.3], ['cat', 0.5], ['dog', 0.7], ['cat', 0.7], ['dog', 0.2]]</span>, model predictions <span>[0.3, 0.51, 0.7, 0.49, 0.9, 0.58]</span>, and labels <span>[1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1]</span>. Then, the false positive rate over the feature subset value 'cat' would be 1.0, compared to the overall metric of 0.67.</p>

<h3>Discrimination By Proxy<a class="headerlink" href="#discrimination-by-proxy" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>This test checks whether any feature is a proxy for a protected feature. It runs over categorical features, using mutual information as a measure of similarity with a protected feature. Mutual information measures any dependencies between two variables.</p><p><b>Why it matters:</b> A common strategy to try to ensure a model is not biased is to remove protected features from the training data entirely so the model cannot learn over them. However, if other features are highly dependent on those features, that could lead to the model effectively still training over those features by proxy.</p><p><b>Configuration:</b> By default, this test is run over all categorical protected columns.</p><p><b>Example:</b> Suppose we had data with a protected feature ('gender'). If there was another feature, like 'title', which was highly associated with 'gender', this test would raise a warning if the mutual information between those two features was particularly high.</p>

<h3>Subset Drift Accuracy<a class="headerlink" href="#subset-drift-accuracy" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>This test checks whether the model performs equally well across a given subset of rows as it does across the whole dataset. The key detail displays the performance difference between the lowest performing subset and the overall population. The test first splits the dataset into various subsets depending on the quantiles of a given feature column. If the feature is categorical, the data is split based on the feature values.

Accuracy can be thought of as a 'weaker' metric of model bias compared to measuring false positive rate (predictive equality) or false negative rate (equal opportunity). This is because we can have similar accuracy between group A and group B; yet group A actually has higher false positive rate, while group B has higher false negative rate (e.g. we reject qualified applicants in group A but accept non-qualified applicants in group B). Nevertheless, accuracy is a standard metric used during evaluation and should be considered as part of performance bias testing.</p><p><b>Configuration:</b> By default, accuracy is computed over all predictions/labels. Note we round predictions to 0/1 to compute accuracy.</p><p><b>Example:</b> Suppose we had data with 2 features: <span>[['cat', 0.2], ['dog', 0.3], ['cat', 0.5], ['dog', 0.7], ['cat', 0.7], ['dog', 0.2]]</span>, model predictions <span>[0.3, 0.51, 0.7, 0.49, 0.9, 0.58]</span>, and labels <span>[1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1]</span>.
