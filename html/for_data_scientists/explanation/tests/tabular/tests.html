<h3>Nulls Per Feature Drift<a class="headerlink" href="#nulls-per-feature-drift" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>This test measures the severity of passing to the model data points that have features with a null proportion that has drifted from the distribution observed in the reference set. The severity is a function of the impact on the model, as well as the presence of drift in the data. The model impact measures how much model performance changes due to drift in the given feature.

A big shift in null value proportion could indicate a degradation in model performance and signal the need for relabeling and retraining. </p><p><b>Configuration:</b> By default, this test runs over all columns with sufficiently many samples. </p><p><b>Example:</b> Suppose that the observed frequencies of the null values for a given feature is 100/2000 in the reference set but 100/1500 in the test.

The severity is a function of the impact on the model, as well as the presence of drift in the data.

<h3>Feature Correlation Drift<a class="headerlink" href="#feature-correlation-drift" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>This test measures the severity of feature correlation drift from the reference to the evaluation set for a given pair of features. The severity is a function of the mutual information drift in the data. The key detail is the difference in correlation scores between the reference and evaluation sets, along with an associated p-value. Correlation is a measure of the linear relationship between two numeric features, so this test checks for significant changes in this relationship between pairs of features in the reference and evaluation sets. To compute the p-value, we use Fisher's z-transformation to convert the distribution of sample correlations to a normal distribution, and then we run a standard two-sample test on two normal distributions.</p><p><b>Why it matters:</b> Correlation drift between training and inference can be caused by a variety of factors, including a change in the data generation process or a change in the underlying processing stage. A big shift in these dependencies could indicate shifting datasets and degradation in model performance, signalling the need for relabeling and retraining.</p><p><b>Configuration:</b> By default, this test runs over all pairs of features in the dataset.</p><p><b>Example:</b> Suppose that the correlation between <span>country</span> and <span>state</span> is 0.5 in the reference set but 0.7 in the evaluation set, and the p-value is 0.03. Then the large difference in scores indicates that the dependency between the two features has drifted. If our difference threshold was 0.2, and p-value threshold was 0.05, then the test would fail.</p>

<h3>Categorical Feature Drift<a class="headerlink" href="#categorical-feature-drift" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>This test measures the severity of passing to the model data points that have categorical features which have drifted from the distribution observed in the reference set. The severity is a function of the impact on the model, as well as the presence of drift in the data. The model impact measures how much model performance changes due to drift in the given feature. The key detail displayed is the PSI test statistic, which is a measure of how statistically significant the difference between the frequencies of categorical values in the reference and evaluation sets is.</p><p><b>Why it matters:</b> Distribution drift in categorical features between training and inference can be caused by a variety of factors, including a change in the data generation process or a change in the preprocessing pipeline. A big shift in categorical features towards categorical subsets that your model performs poorly in could indicate a degradation in model performance and signal the need for relabeling and retraining. </p><p><b>Configuration:</b> By default, this test runs over all categorical columns with sufficiently many samples. </p><p><b>Example:</b> Suppose that the observed frequencies of the <span>isLoggedIn</span> feature is [100, 200] in the reference set but [25, 150] in the test set.

<h3>Label Drift (PSI)<a class="headerlink" href="#label-drift-psi" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>This test checks that the difference in label distribution between the reference and evaluation sets is small, using PSI test. The key detail displayed is the PSI statistic which is a measure of how different the frequencies of the column in the reference and evaluation sets are.</p><p><b>Why it matters:</b> Label distribution shift between reference and test can indicate that the underlying data distribution has changed significantly enough to modify model decisions. This may mean that the model needs to be retrained to adjust to the new data environment. In addition, significant label distribution shift may indicate that upstream decision-making modules (e.g. thresholds) may need to be updated.</p><p><b>Configuration:</b> This test is run by default whenever both the reference and evaluation sets have associated labels.</p><p><b>Example:</b> Suppose that the observed frequencies of the label column is [100, 200] in the reference set but [25, 150] in the test set.

<h3>Numeric Feature Drift<a class="headerlink" href="#numeric-feature-drift" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>This test measures the severity of passing to the model data points that have numeric features that have drifted from the distribution observed in the reference set. The severity is a function of the impact on the model, as well as the presence of drift in the data. The model impact measures how much model performance changes due to drift in the given feature. The key detail is the Population Stability Index statistic. The Population Stability Index (PSI) is a measure of how different two distributions are. Given two distributions P and Q, it is computed as the sum of the KL Divergence between P and Q and the (reverse) KL Divergence between Q and P. Thus, PSI is symmetric.</p><p><b>Why it matters:</b> Distribution shift between training and inference can cause degradation in model performance. If the shift is sufficiently large, retraining the model on newer data may be necessary.</p><p><b>Configuration:</b> By default, this test runs over all numeric columns with sufficiently many samples and stored quantiles in each of the reference and evaluation sets.</p><p><b>Example:</b> Suppose that the distribution of a feature <span>Age</span> changes between the reference and evaluation sets such that the Population Stability Index between these two samples is <span>0.2</span>.

<h3>Calibration Comparison<a class="headerlink" href="#calibration-comparison" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>This test checks that the reference and evaluation sets have sufficiently similar calibration curves as measured by the Mean Squared Error (MSE) between the two curves. The calibration curve is a line plot where the x-axis represents the average predicted probability and the y-axis is the proportion of positive predictions. The curve of the ideal calibrated model is thus a linear straight line from (0, 0) moving linearly.</p><p><b>Why it matters:</b> Knowing how well-calibrated your model is can help you better interpret and act upon model outputs, and can even be an indicator of generalization. A greater difference between reference and evaluation curves could indicate a lack of generalizability. In addition, a change in calibration could indicate that decision-making or thresholding conducted upstream needs to change as it is behaving differently on held-out data.</p><p><b>Configuration:</b> By default, this test runs over the predictions and labels.</p><p><b>Example:</b> Suppose the model’s task is binary classification and predicts whether or not a datapoint is fraudulent. If we have a reference set in which <span>1%</span> of the datapoints are fraudulent, but an evaluation set where <span>50%</span> are fraudulent, then our model may not be well calibrated, and the MSE difference in the curves will be large, resulting in a failing test.</p>

<h3>Demographic Parity<a class="headerlink" href="#demographic-parity" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>This test is commonly known as the demographic parity or statistical parity test in fairness literature. This test checks whether the model performs equally well across a given subset of rows as it does across the whole dataset. The key detail displays the performance difference between the lowest performing subset and the overall population. The test first splits the dataset into various subsets depending on the quantiles of a given feature column. If the feature is categorical, the data is split based on the feature values. We then test whether the Positive Prediction Rate of model predictions within a specific subset is significantly different than the model prediction Positive Prediction Rate over the entire 'population'. </p><p><b>Why it matters:</b> Demographic parity is one of the most well-known and strict measures of fairness. It is meant to be used in a setting where we assert that the base label rates between subgroups should be the same (even if empirically they are different). This contrasts with equality of opportunity or predictive parity tests, which permit classification rates to depend on a protected attribute. It can be useful in legal/compliance settings where we want a selection rate for any protected group to fundamentally be the same as other groups. </p><p><b>Configuration:</b> By default, the Positive Prediction Rate is computed for all protected features. </p><p><b>Example:</b> Suppose we had data with the following protected feature 'animal': <span>['cat', 'cat', 'cat', 'dog', 'dog', 'dog']</span>, and model predictions <span>[0.3, 0.3, 0.9, 0.9, 0.9, 0.3]</span>.

<h3>Protected Feature Drift<a class="headerlink" href="#protected-feature-drift" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>This test measures the severity of passing to the model data points that have categorical features which have drifted from the distribution observed in the reference set. The severity is a function of the impact on the model, as well as the presence of drift in the data. The model impact measures how much model performance changes due to drift in the given feature. The key detail displayed is the Χ² test statistic and p-value, which are measures of how statistically significant the difference between the frequencies of categorical values in the reference and evaluation sets is.</p><p><b>Why it matters:</b> Distribution drift in categorical features between training and inference can be caused by a variety of factors, including a change in the data generation process or a change in the preprocessing pipeline. A big shift in categorical features towards categorical subsets that your model performs poorly in could indicate a degradation in model performance and signal the need for relabeling and retraining. </p><p><b>Configuration:</b> By default, this test runs over all categorical columns with sufficiently many samples. </p><p><b>Example:</b> Suppose that the observed frequencies of the <span>isLoggedIn</span> feature is [100, 200] in the reference set but [75, 100] in the test set. Then the p-value would be 0.048. If our p-value threshold was 0.05 then the test would fail.</p>

<h3>Discrimination By Proxy<a class="headerlink" href="#discrimination-by-proxy" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>This test checks whether any feature is a proxy for a protected feature. It runs over categorical features, using mutual information as a measure of similarity with a protected feature. Mutual information measures any dependencies between two variables.</p><p><b>Why it matters:</b> A common strategy to try to ensure a model is not biased is to remove protected features from the training data entirely so the model cannot learn over them. However, if other features are highly dependent on those features, that could lead to the model effectively still training over those features by proxy.</p><p><b>Configuration:</b> By default, this test is run over all categorical protected columns.</p><p><b>Example:</b> Suppose we had data with a protected feature (`gender`). If there was another feature, like `title`, which was highly associated with gender, this test would raise a warning if the mutual information between those two features was particularly high.</p>

<h3>Intersectional Group Fairness<a class="headerlink" href="#intersectional-group-fairness" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>This test checks whether the model performs equally well across subgroups created from the intersection of protected groups. The test first creates unique pairs of categorical protected features. We then test whether the positive prediction rate of model predictions within a specific subset is significantly lower than the model positive prediction rate over the entire population. This will expose hidden biases against groups at the intersection of these protected features</p><p><b>Why it matters:</b> Most existing work in the fairness literature deals with a binary view of fairness - either a particular group is performing worse or not. This binary categorization misses the important nuance of the fairness field - that biases can often be amplified in subgroups that combine membership from different protected groups, especially if such a subgroup is particularly underrepresented in opportunities historically. The intersectional group fairness test is run over subsets representing this intersection between two protected groups.</p><p><b>Configuration:</b> This test runs over unique pairs of categorical protected features.</p><p><b>Example:</b> Suppose your dataset contains two protected features: race and gender. Both features pass the demographic parity test for categories women, men, white and black. However, when certain subsets of these features are combined, such as black women or white men, the positive prediction rates perform significantly worse than the overall population. This would show disparate impact towards this subgroup.</p>

<section id="selection-rate">
<h3>Selection Rate<a class="headerlink" href="#selection-rate" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>This test checks whether the selection rate for any subset of a feature performs as well as the best selection rate across all subsets of that feature. The selection rate is calculated as the Positive Prediction Rate. The test first splits the dataset into various subsets depending on the quantiles of a given feature column. If the feature is categorical, the data is split based on the feature values. We then test whether the selection rate of model predictions within a specific subset is significantly lower than that of other subsets by taking a ratio of the rates.</p><p><b>Why it matters:</b> Assessing differences in selection rate is an important measures of fairness. It is meant to be used in a setting where we assert that the base selection rates between subgroups should be the same (even if empirically they are different). This contrasts with equality of opportunity or predictive parity tests, which permit classification rates to depend on a sensitive attribute. It can be useful in legal/compliance settings where we want a selection rate for any sensitive group to fundamentally be the same as other groups. </p><p><b>Configuration:</b> By default, the selection rate is computed for all protected features. </p><p><b>Example:</b> Suppose we had data with the following protected feature 'animal': <span>['cat', 'cat', 'cat', 'dog', 'dog', 'dog']</span>, and model predictions <span>[0.3, 0.3, 0.9, 0.9, 0.9, 0.3]</span>. Then regardless of the labels, the selection rate over the feature values ('cat', 'dog') would be (0.33, 0.66), indicating a failure because cats would be selected half as often as dogs.</p>

<section id="feature-independence">
<h3>Feature Independence<a class="headerlink" href="#feature-independence" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>This test checks the independence of each protected feature with the predicted label class. It runs over categorical protected features and uses the chi square test of independence to determine the feature independence. The test compares the observed data to a model that distributes the data according to the expectation that the variables are independent. Wherever the observed data does not fit the model, the likelihood that the variables are dependent becomes stronger.</p><p><b>Why it matters:</b> A test of independence assesses whether observations consisting of measures on two variables, expressed in a contingency table, are independent of each other. This can be useful when assessing how protected features impact the predicted class and helping with the feature selection process.</p><p><b>Configuration:</b> By default, this test is run over all protected categorical features.</p><p><b>Example:</b> Let's say you have a model that predicts whether or not a person will be hired or not. One protected feature is gender. If these two variables are independent then the male-female ratio across hired and not hired should be the same. The p-value is 0.06 and the chi squared value is 300. The p-value is above the threshold of 0.05 to declare independence.</p>

<section id="subset-sensitivity">
<h3>Subset Sensitivity<a class="headerlink" href="#subset-sensitivity" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>This test measures how sensitive the model is to substituting the lowest performing subset of a feature into a sample of data. The test splits the dataset into various subsets based on the feature values and finds the lowest performing subset, based on the lowest Positive Prediction Rate. The test then substitutes this subset into a sample from the original data and calculates the average prediction change. This test fails if a model predicts worse on the lowest performing subset.</p><p><b>Why it matters:</b> Assessing differences in model output is an important measure of fairness. If the model performs worse because of the value of a protected feature such as race or gender, then this could indicate bias. It can be useful in legal/compliance settings where we fundamentally want the prediction for any protected group to be the same as for other groups. </p><p><b>Configuration:</b> By default, the subset sensitivity is computed for all protected features that are strings.</p><p><b>Example:</b> Suppose the data had the following protected feature 'animal': <span>['cat', 'cat', 'cat', 'dog', 'dog', 'dog', 'horse', 'horse']</span>, and model predictions for cat were the lowest. If substituting cat for dog and horse in the other inputs causes model predictions to decrease, then this would indicate a failure because the model disadvantages cats.</p>

<p>Feature leakage occurs when a model is trained on features that include information about the label that is not normally present during production.This tests flags a likely data leakage issue if both of the following occur:<ul><li>the normalized mutual information between the feature and the label is too high in the reference set</li><li>the normalized mutual information for the reference set is much higher than for the evaluation set</li></ul> The first criteria is an indicator that this feature has unreasonably high predictive power for the label during training, and the second criteria checks that this feature is no longer a good predictor in the evaluation set. One requirement for this test to flag data leakage is that the evaluation set labels and features are collected properly.</p><p><b>Why it matters:</b> Errors in data collection and processing can lead to the some features containing information about the label in the reference set that do not appear in the evaluation set. This causes the model to under-perform during production.</p><p><b>Configuration:</b> By default, this test always runs on all categorical features.</p><p><b>Example:</b> Consider a lending model that is trying to predict a boolean variable <span>loan given</span> that reports whether or not a bank will issue this loan to a potential borrower, and suppose one of the features is <span>total debt</span>. An error during the data processing causes the model to be trained on a data set where <span>total debt</span> is calculated after the loan has already been given, resulting in the model predicting <span>loan given</span> to be true whenever <span>total debt</span> is large. However, when the model is deployed, the feature <span>total debt</span> must be calculated before the <span>loan given</span> prediction can be made.<br>The normalized mutual information between these columns might be 0.3 in the reference set but only 0.1 in the evaluation set. This test would then flag a likely feature leakage issue where <span>total debt</span> is leaking into the variable <span>loan given</span> during training.</p>

We then test whether the variance of model predictions within a specific subset is significantly higher than model prediction variance of the entire 'population'. In this test, the population refers to all data with both positive/negative ground-truth labels.</p><p><b>Why it matters:</b> High variance within a feature subset compared to the overall population could mean a few different things, and should be analyzed with other subset performance tests (accuracy, AUC) for a more clear view. In this variance metric over all labels, it could mean the label variance itself is higher within a subgroup. It could mean the model is much more uncertain about the given subset (especially when paired with a decrease in AUC). On the other hand it could mean the model has gained predictive power on the subset (imagine the model outputting accurate predictions close to 0 and 1 within the subset, and 0.5 everywhere else). </p><p><b>Configuration:</b> By default, the variance is computed over all predictions across all ground-truth labels.</p><p><b>Example:</b> Suppose we had data with 2 features: [['cat', 0.2], ['dog', 0.3], ['cat', 0.5], ['dog', 0.7], ['cat', 0.7], ['dog', 0.2]] and model predictions [0.3, 0.51, 0.7, 0.49, 0.9, 0.48]. Then the prediction variance for feature column 1, subset 'cat' would be 0.062.</p>

<h3>Subset Rank Correlation<a class="headerlink" href="#subset-rank-correlation" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>This test checks whether the model performs equally well across a given subset of rows as it does across the whole dataset.
