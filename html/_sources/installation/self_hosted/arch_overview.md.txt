# Architecture Overview

In this configuration, **both planes** are hosted in your organizationâ€™s private cloud.

The self-deployed configuration provides complete control over the RIME cluster's behavior,
including routing rule configuration, storage management, and compute resource optimization
for model testin jobs.

## Cloud Services
AWS services used by RIME include:
- IAM
  - manages roles for internal services, which enable:
    - reading and writing data from S3
    - building images and pushing them to ECR
    - autoscaling cluster nodes by changing autoscaling group targets
    - configuring DNS records in route53 for external access
- EKS/EC2/ELB
  - creates the Kubernetes cluster, the constituent nodes of that cluster, and load balancers for external access
- Route 53/ACM
  - manages records for external access to the API layer, validated by SSL certificates
- VPC
  - isolates the EKS cluster
- Secrets Manager
  - used during installation
- S3
  - stores and serves data and models

Other cloud services used by the RI Platform include:
- Velero
  - provides backup and disaster recovery
- Hashicorp Vault
  - provides secrets management
- OIDC Authentication (Optional)
  - integrates with your existing identity provider
- SMTP Service (Optional)
  - sends email notifications related to model testing
- DataDog (Optional)
  - provides cluster health monitoring

## Terraform
Robust Intelligence provides Terraform template modules to reduce the work involved in deploying RIME.
Robust Intelligence staff is available to assist filling out the template modules.

Robust Intelligence staff can assist your DevOps team to design appropriate integration
strategies for deployments that do not use AWS.
