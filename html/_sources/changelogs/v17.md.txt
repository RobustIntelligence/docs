# RIME v17 Release Note

## User Guides
- **Demo Notebooks** - Users have access to several google colab notebooks that showcase how to use the different RIME capabilties.
[Demo Notebooks can be found here.](../for_data_scientists/get_started.rst) 
- **Integrations** - Users have access to several notebooks and configurations that show how RIME can be integrated across the MLOps stack (Platforms, Model Frameowrks, Data Sources). 
[Integration Notebooks can be found here.](../for_data_scientists/how_to_guides.rst) 



## Stress Tests

- **Test Progress** - After kicking off a stress testing or continuous testing job, 
you can now monitor the progress of that job using the SDK. Additionally for stress testing, the status
and progress of the job appears in the UI. [More information here.](../for_data_scientists/how_to_guides/alerting/test_run_progress.md)
- **Custom metrics** - Users can now create their own custom metrics to implement and track custom logic. Custom metrics appear under the model metrics. 
[More information here.](../for_data_scientists/how_to_guides/customization/custom_metrics.md)
- **Performance Improvements** - Faster load times of stress test runs. 




## Firewall and Continuous Testing
- **Additional Continuous Testing Bin Choices** -  Users can run hourly, daily, monthly and yearly bin-size for Continuous Testing.
- **Custom Metric** - These metrics show up over time in the Continuous Testing time series plot and are part of the summary metrics.

[Here is a guide on how to query results.](../for_data_scientists/how_to_guides/common_use_cases/querying_results.md)
- **General Usability** - Several updates were made to the structure, classes, and methods of the Python SDK
