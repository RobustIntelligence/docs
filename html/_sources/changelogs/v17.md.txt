## Stress Tests

- **Test Progress** - After kicking off a stress testing or continuous testing job, 
you can now monitor the progress of that job using the SDK. Additionally for stress testing, the status
and progress of the job appears in the UI. [More information here.](/for_data_scientists/how_to_guides/alerting/test_run_progress.md)
- **Custom metrics** - Users can now create their own custom metrics to implement and track custom logic. Custom metrics appear under the model metrics. 
[More information here.](/for_data_scientists/how_to_guides/customization/custom_metrics.md)
