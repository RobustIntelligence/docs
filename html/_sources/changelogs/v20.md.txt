# RIME v20 Release Note

## Important Notes
- All deployments now require [authentication](../for_admins/userauthn.md). Users can log in using native
authentication or SSO.
- [Workspaces](../for_admins/workspaces.md) are now part of the Robust Intelligence Platform. Upgrading
an existing deployment moves all objects on the deployment to a default
"Workspace 1" and assigned the existing agent.
- [API](../for_admins/api-authentication.md) tokens are now associated with a user. Upgrading an existing deployment
assigns all API tokens to "Workspace 1" and the default administrative user
account.
- The behavior of the `get_firewall_id` endpoint has changed. Upgrade the Python SDK to continue using Firewall and Continuous Testing functionality that depends on this endpoint.

## Changelog

### General
- **RBAC for Workspaces and Projects** - Access to workspaces and projects in the RI Platform is mediated by Role-based Access Control ([RBAC](../for_admins/rbac.md)).
- **Data source configuration** - The Databricks data source can be [configured](../for_admins/data-sources.md) directly from the RI Platform web UI, with workspace-wide or user-specific credentials.
- **Managed Images** - [Managed Images](../for_admins/mimgoverview.md) can be built from base images across Python versions 3.7, 3.8, and 3.9.
- **Model Cards** - (Feature flag required) [Model Card](../for_data_scientists/how_to_guides/common_use_cases/modelcards.md) generation uses a content builder system that
enables users to select relevant information to include. The selections can be
saved and the model card can be saved locally as a PDF.
- **Embeddings** - The [embeddings](../for_data_scientists/how_to_guides/common_use_cases/embeddings.md) for a model can now be passed to the RI Platform.

### SDK

- Initializing the Client object no longer requires an `ssl_config` dictionary of byte strings for authentication. Authenticate by providing filepaths as values to the `ssl_ca_cert`, `cert_file`, and `key_file` parameters instead.
- Users no longer have access to the backend parameter of a Client object in the SDK.
- The “tests” module has been renamed “test_batch” in the SDK. New usage is `from test_batch import TestBatch`.
- The `get_status` method for job objects in the SDK now hides the empty `archived_job_logs` field.

### Stress Testing
- **Default tests** - Abnormal Inputs, Drift, and Data Cleanliness tests no longer run by default in Stress Testing. The behavior of these tests is unchanged in Continuous Testing.

### Test Suite
- **Hiring Compliance** - The Hiring Compliance test is deprecated. Use the Bias and Fairness test instead.
- **Bias and Fairness** - The Bias and Fairness test only runs when protected features are specified.
- **Demographic Parity** - The Selection Rate test has been combined with the Demographic Parity test. The demographic parity threshold represents the former selection rate.
