# Summary Tests
## Drift
Test for differences in the distribution of the reference dataset versus the evaluation dataset.If predictions and labels are provided, measure the performance degradation caused by shifting data as well as drift in predictions and labels themselves.<br><b>Data Requirements:</b> Labels and predictions are not required but they improve results.
## Abnormal Inputs
Check the evaluation dataset for abnormal values commonly encountered in production.If model predictions are provided, test if the observed abnormal values cause a degradation in your model’s performance.<br><b>Data Requirements:</b> Labels and predictions are not required but they improve results.
## Subset Performance
Test that your model performs equally well across different subsets of the evaluation dataset.<br><b>Data Requirements:</b> Predictions are required. Labels are required for most tests.
## Bias and Fairness
Test that your model does not discriminate based on protected features.<br><b>Data Requirements:</b> For some tests predictions, labels and/or model are required.
## Transformations
Augment your evaluation dataset with synthetic abnormal values to proactively test your pipeline’s error-handling behavior and measure the performance degradation caused by different types of abnormal values.<br><b>Data Requirements:</b> Model is required. Labels are not required but they improve results.
## Model Performance
Test that your model performs well on the evaluation dataset and is not degrading in performance.<br><b>Data Requirements:</b> Predictions are required. Labels are required for exact performance metrics, otherwise approximate performance metrics will be used.
## Data Cleanliness
Test for data reliability by checking that your data is consistent and complete.<br><b>Data Requirements:</b> This category only requires input data.
## Adversarial
Test the robustness of your model by measuring the worst-case change in model predictions that can be caused by small perturbations to data points.<br><b>Data Requirements:</b> Model is required.
## Subset Performance Degradation
Test that your model's performance on different subsets of the data has not degraded.<br><b>Data Requirements:</b> Predictions are required. Labels are required for most tests.
## Data Poisoning Detection
Test for the presence of potentially corrupted samples in your data.<br>Note that the default behavior of this test category in Continuous Testing depends on the quality of data used for the initial stress test.If corrupted samples were detected in the stress test, then the continuous test will be more  permissive.<br><b>Data Requirements:</b> Labels are required.
## Evasion Attack Detection
Test for the presence of adversarial evasion attacks against your model.<br><b>Data Requirements:</b> This category only requires input data.
