# Projects

A RIME project collects test runs or an AI Firewall that relate to a shared machine learning task.
Each model for the task is tested by an individual test run. An AI Firewall monitors a currently promoted
model over time by continuously testing that model.

## Creating a Project

You can use the RIME SDK or the RIME web UI to create a new project.

### With the RIME SDK

Verify that the SDK client is initialized. If necessary, initialize the SDK client now.

{{ sdk_client_setup }}

Create a project by calling the `create_project()` method, which returns a `Project` object.

```python
project = rime_client.create_project("<NAME>", "<DESCRIPTION>")
```

### Creating a project from the RIME web UI

1.  Sign in to a RIME instance.  
    >    The Workspaces page appears.
2.  Click a workspace.  
    >    The Workspaces summary page appears.
3.  Click *+ New Project*.
    >   The Create New Project wizard appears.
4.  In *Name*, type a name for the new project.
5.  (Optional) In *Brief Description*, type a description of the new project.
6.  Select a project testing mode and click *Next*.
    >   A new project can start in either the Stress or the Continuous testing mode.
    >   The wizard advances to the next step.
7.  From the *Model Task* drop-down, select a task.
    >   Enter a string in the *Search* field to filter the task list by that string.
8.  (Optional) In *Intended Use Case*, type a use case.
9.  (Optional) From the *Tags* drop-down, select a tag.
    >   Enter a string in the field to create a new tag. Click the `x` in a selected tag to remove that tag.
10. (Optional) In *Ethical Considerations*, type any ethical considerations that apply.
11. Click *Next*.
    >   The wizard advances to the next step.
12. (Optional) In *Sharing*, type the email addresses to share this project with.
13. (Optional) From the *View Access* drop-down, select a sharing privilege level.
    >   The sharing privilege levels are *Full Access*, *Edit Access*, *View Access*, and *No Access (Private)*.
