# Projects

A RIME project collects test runs or an AI Firewall that relate to a shared machine learning task.
Each model for the task is tested by an individual test run. An AI Firewall monitors a currently promoted
model over time by continuously testing that model.

## Creating a Project

You can use the RIME SDK or the RIME web UI to create a new project.

### With the RIME SDK

Verify that the SDK client is initialized. If necessary, initialize the SDK client now.

{{ sdk_client_setup }}

Create a project by calling the `create_project()` method, which returns a `Project` object.

```python
project = rime_client.create_project("<NAME>", "<DESCRIPTION>")
```

6.  Choose a starting mode for the project.
    >   | Mode | Description |
    >   |------|-------------|
    >   | Stress Testing for Production Readiness | Evaluates a model's resilience with regards to a specific vulnerability |
    >   | Continuous Testing and Monitoring | Monitors a model's ongoing performance in a production environment |
7.  From the *Model Task* drop-down, select a task.
8.  (Optional) Type a use case in *Intended Use Case (optional)*.
9.  (Optional) Select a set of tags from the *Tags (optional)* drop-down.

13. In *General Access*, select a user category.
    >   User categories are workspace members, users with the VP role, and users with the Administrator role.
14. From the *Access* drop-down for the selected category, select an access level.
    >   | Level | Privileges |
    >   |-------|------------|
    >   | Edit Access | Users in the workspace can freely edit the project. |
    >   | View Access | Users in the workspace can view the project. |
    >   | No Access | The project is not displayed to other users in the workspace. |
15. (Optional) Toggle *Add to Workspace Overview*.
