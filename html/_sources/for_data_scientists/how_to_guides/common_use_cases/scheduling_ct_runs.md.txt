# Scheduling Continuous Testing runs

You can create and update the schedule for a Continuous Test from the SDK or the UI. For
more configuration information, see the [Scheduled CT Configuration Page](scheduled_ct_configuration.md)

## Activating a schedule

### Creating a schedule with a new Continuous Test from SDK

{{ sdk_client_setup }}

You can set a schedule at the same time you [create a Continuous Test](ct-ui.md). To create a 
schedule, specify a data source as well as any credentials required for access to the
data source.

Determine the IDs for the model and dataset in the [RIME Registry](../registries.md).

Optionally, provide parameters to process this data, such as timestamp column names.

```python
data_params_dict = {
    "nrows": 100
}

# Create a firewall with an active schedule.
# The data loaded has a timestamp column defined above.
firewall = project.create_firewall(model_id, ref_data_id, timedelta(days=2))
```

Since each data location requires specific parameters for the RIME Engine to access and
process the data, see the [Scheduled CT Configuration Page](scheduled_ct_configuration.md)
for details about configurations for different use cases.

### Creating a schedule on an existing Continuous Test from the SDK

You can enable a schedule for an existing Continuous Test at any time.

```python
# Get a Continuous Test from a project
firewall = rime_client.get_firewall_for_project("foo-project")

# Activate a schedule
firewall.activate_ct_schedule(location_type="data_collector", reference_set_window=reference_set_bin, data_params=data_params_dict)
```

## Deactivating a schedule from the SDK

To deactivate a schedule for a Contnuous Test, run the following command.

```python
firewall.deactivate_ct_schedule()
```

## Activating and deactivating a schedule from the UI

Choose an [integration](../../../for_admins/data-integrations.md) to use as a data 
source. The current supported options are Databricks Delta Lake, the Data Collector, 
or a custom data loader.

Specify a table and timestamp column.

For the custom loader, specify the path of the custom loading file, the name of the 
function that loads the data, any relevant keyword arguments in JSON format, and the 
timestamp column.

## Additional specifications

## Modifying the reference dataset

In addition to specifying access and process parameters, you can also modify the 
reference data that tests are routinely run against.

A Continuous Test run can use a [registered](../registries.md) dataset, a rolling time
window, or a specific time period.

From the UI, choose a reference dataset in the "Reference Set" dropdown and fill in the relevant fields.
For the non-default options, the reference dataset always comes from the same data source that is specified for CT scheduling.

You can also specify the reference dataset from the SDK.

```python
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

# Specify a duration for the rolling window.
# The reference set will change each period based on the window size
rolling_window_period = timedelta(days=1)
firewall.activate_ct_schedule(location_type="data_collector", rolling_window_duration=rolling_window_period)

# Specify a new time period as the reference set
reference_start_time = datetime(2022, 1, 3)
reference_end_time = datetime(2021, 1, 3)
reference_set_bin = (reference_start_time, reference_end_time)
firewall.activate_ct_schedule(location_type="data_collector", reference_set_window=reference_set_bin)
```

### Modifying existing schedules

To change the data location associated with your runs or the reference set, use the `update_location_info`
function.

```python
from datetime import datetime

# Specify a new time period as the reference set
reference_start_time = datetime(2022, 1, 3)
reference_end_time = datetime(2021, 1, 3)
reference_set_bin = (reference_start_time, reference_end_time)
firewall.update_location_info(location_type="data_collector", reference_set_time_bin=reference_set_bin)
```
