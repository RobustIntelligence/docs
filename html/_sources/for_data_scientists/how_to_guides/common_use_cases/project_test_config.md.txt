# Project management operations

A user with the required privilege level can configure several aspects of a project and
the tests within that project, as well as move test runs between existing projects.

An audit trail of the changes to project settings is available by selecting *Settings
History* from the left navigation bar of the project settings page.

## Configuring a project from the project settings page

The project settings page enables you to modify the following configuration aspects:

* Project configuration
* Configuration of the model used by the project
* Configuration of the test runs for the model
* Configuration of the actual tests run on the model
