# Stress Tests

A stress test evaluates a machine learning model's resilience with regards to a specific
vulnerability.

## Creating a new Stress Test

1.  Sign in to an RI Platform instance.  
    >   The Workspaces page appears.
2.  Select a workspace.  
    >   The workspace summary page appears, listing the projects in that workspace.
3.  Select a project.  
    >   The project summary page appears.
4.  From the left navigation bar, click *Stress Testing*.
    >   The Stress Testing page appears.
5.  Click *Create Stress Test*.
    >   The Stress Test wizard appears.
6.  From the *Test Configuration* drop-down, choose a configuration type.
    >   | Type | Description |
    >   |------|-------------|
    >   | From Project Configuration | Uses the project configuration for this stress test. |
    >   | Custom | Enables you to specify a test configuration for this stress test. |
7.  (When using Custom only) Select the types of risks to evaluate in this stress test.
8.  Click *Next*.
9.  Choose a model to test from the list of registered models or register a new model.
10. (When using a registered model) Select the model from the *Select Model* drop-down.
11. (When registering a new model) Choose whether to upload a model file or to add a model from an online registry.
12. (When uploading a new model) Type a name and tags for the model.
13. (When uploading a new model) Drag a `pkl` or `py` model file to the wizard or click *Select File* to browse the file system.
14. (When registering a new model from a registry) Type the name of the registry, the URI or file path to the model in the registry, and the registry secret.
15. Click *Next*.
16. Choose whether to use a registered reference dataset, a dataset from a connection, or a manually uploaded dataset.
17. (Using a registered reference dataset) Type the name of the registered dataset.
18. (Using a reference dataset from a connection) Type a connection name, a table name, a timestamp column, and a label column
19. (Using a reference dataset from a connection) (Optional) Activate the *Predictions (optional) toggle and enter a connection name, table name, optional timestamp column, and prediction column.
20. (Uploading a reference dataset) Drag a dataset file to the wizard or click *Select File* to browse the file system.
    >   RIME accepts datasets in the `csv`, Parquet, `jsonl`, `jsonl.gz`, and `json.gz` formats.
21. (Uploading a reference dataset) (Optional) Activate the *Predictions (optional)* toggle and enter a name, label column name, and optional prediction column name, then drag a predictions file to the wizard or click *Select File* to browse the file system.
    >   RIME accepts datasets in the `csv`, Parquet, `jsonl`, `jsonl.gz`, and `json.gz` formats.
22. Click *Next*.

The wizard closes and the new Stress Test begins initial processing.
