# RIME Registries

RIME provides registries to keep track of the models, datasets, and predictions files 
that have been uploaded to a RIME instance. You can register these data objects from 
the RIME SDK or in the RIME web UI during project configuration.

Models are typically Python files in either `py` or `pkl` formats. Reference or 
evaluation datasets and prediction sets can be provided in several formats, most
commonly CSV.

Any of these data objects can be directly uploaded to the RIME instance using the SDK
or sourced from an [integration](../../for_admins/data-integrations.md). Register the data
object after upload.

Once a model, dataset, or prediction set has been registered with a RIME instance,
that data object is available for selection in the appropriate drop-down selectors
during project configuration for either a [Stress test](common_use_cases/st-ui.md) or a [Continuous test](common_use_cases/ct-ui.md).

## Registering a model, dataset, or prediction set with a RIME instance using the SDK

This procedure assumes the RIME SDK is installed and available for use and that the 
relevant data objects have been uploaded to the RIME instance. See the Python
SDK documentation for full details on the SDK calls used in this procedure.

1. Choose an existing project or create a new project.
    >   |                  |                                 |
    >   |------------------|---------------------------------|
    >   | Existing project | Use the `client.get_project` call with the ID of the project. |
    >   | New project      | Use the `client.create_project` call to create the new project. |
2.  Use the correct `register` call based on the type of object being registered.
    >   | Data object type | SDK call                       |
    >   |------------------|--------------------------------|
    >   | Model            | `project.register_model`       |
    >   | Dataset          | `project.register_dataset`     |
    >   | Prediction set   | `project.register_predictions` |

The registered data objects are now available from the UI during project configuration.
