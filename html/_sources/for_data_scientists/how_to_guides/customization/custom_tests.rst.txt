Custom Tests
================================

In order to use the custom test functionality, you first need to define the custom test. This should be
exposed in a Python file. This is slightly different for each modality. Please see below for detailed
descriptions of what the Python file should look like for each modality.

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1

   tabular_custom_tests.md
   nlp_custom_tests.md

Once this python file exists, we need to include it in the test configuration for a given run.
This is done with the ``custom_tests`` key within either the ``tests_config_path`` or ``tests_config``, eg:

.. code-block:: json

   "tests_config": {"custom_tests": [{"test_path": "path/to/file.py"}]}
