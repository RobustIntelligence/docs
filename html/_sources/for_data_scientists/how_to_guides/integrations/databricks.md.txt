# RIME ü§ù Databricks

This walkthrough will cover how to integrate AI Stress Testing and the AI Firewall 
into your workflow on the Databricks platform. This assumes you have already set up your
Databricks account and have a cluster deployed.

First, download the [Databricks + MLflow Walkthrough Notebook here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/iztx1h8pbb5cbfu/RIME_Databricks_MLFlow_Integration.html?dl=1). If you try to open it locally, you'll see instructions on how to **import the notebook** to your Databricks workspace.

Specifically:

- Navigate to your Databricks workspace in the browser.
- Create a new folder in your target workspace. We will upload the walkthrough notebook here.
- Right click the folder and click `import`.

Once the notebook file has been imported, make sure you are attached to an active cluster and follow the instructions to see how AI Stress Testing enhance your existing model development process on Databricks and how the AI Firewall can monitor and secure your models once they are deployed.
