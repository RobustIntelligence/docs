# RIME ü§ù DataRobot

For an end-to-end walkthrough of how RIME integrates with and secures models developed within the DataRobot
ecosystem, check out the [DataRobot Integration Walkthrough](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1tBNt1F4uGDpkoRN3Bfsfo-RXprKMQaMq?usp=sharing).

In the linked Google Colab notebook, you will see how to:

- Apply AI Stress Testing to any model developed on DataRobot.
- Query test results using the RIME SDK to ascertain the robustness of each model.
- Deploy the AI Firewall to protect and monitor your DataRobot models in production.

The walkthrough assumes that you have created a [DataRobot account](https://www.datarobot.com/) 
and have an API Key available to connect to your DataRobot environment using their SDK.

For a focused example on how to define a `model.py` file that connects with your DataRobot model, check
out the [DataRobot Model Integration](datarobot.md) page.
