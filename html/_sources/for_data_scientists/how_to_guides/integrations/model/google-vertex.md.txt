# Google Vertex AI

Copy the code snippet below and follow the commented steps, replacing all the TODOs with necessary credentials/endpoints, to connect RIME to a deployed Google Vertex AI model.

Once that is done, you can specify that model file when [configuring your model source](/for_data_scientists/reference/model_source.md).

```python
"""Template for connecting a model hosted on Google Vertex AI to RIME.

We expect this file to contain a `predict_df` function that takes in a Pandas
DataFrame corresponding to one or more rows in the dataset. This method should
return a NumPy array containing scores between 0 and 1 for each row in the dataset.

This specific file implements this assuming that 1) your Vertex AI model is
hosted on a Google Cloud endpoint, 2) the machine where this is being run 
has the proper permissions to query that endpoint, and 3) that you have the
requests library installed.

# Step 1: Define endpoint variables.
AUTH_TOKEN = "TODO: Add real Google Cloud authorization token."

# Step 2: If the model requires additional preprocessing to the input data, 
# include the logic in the below 'preprocess_df' function or 'predict_df'
# function. By default, RIME passes rows from the dataset defined in the config
# to 'predict_df' with the label and prediction columns omitted.

    """Apply preprocessing to rows of the dataframe."""

    return df

# the dataset, with any additional preprocessing if necessary.
