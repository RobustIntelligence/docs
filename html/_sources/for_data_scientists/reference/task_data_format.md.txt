Input Data Format
=========================

## Supported File Formats

RIME currently supports the following formats:

* [Parquet](https://parquet.apache.org/docs/file-format/)
* Delta lake tables
* JSON
* JSONL
* CSV

The header columns of input files are used as feature names and must be strings.

RIME is most effective when both label and prediction column are provided; however, neither are required for most tasks.

## Requirements By Task

### Binary Classification
- Labels must be the integer values 0 or 1
- Predictions must be float values between 0 and 1 that represent the positive class (label = 1) probability

### Multi-Class Classification
- Labels should be integers referring to class index
- Specify predictions using the [registry](../how_to_guides/registries.md) functionality.

### Ranking
- **Labels are required**
- Labels can be any real number
- Predictions can be any real number
- `ranking_info` must be provided in the [data configuration](data_source.md)

### Regression
- Labels can be any real number
- Predictions can be any real number
