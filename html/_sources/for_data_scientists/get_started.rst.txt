Get Started
================================

First, make sure you have everything set up correctly to run RIME:

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1

   /for_data_scientists/get_started/setup.md


Then, check out one of our **Google Colab** tutorials for a quick introduction into running RIME.

Each notebook illustrates how to use RIME to validate, protect, and monitor your ML pipeline across a wide range of tasks
(from classification to ranking) and data modalities (Tabular, NLP, and Images). 
The datasets and models used in these examples come from well-known public sources like
`UCI ML <https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/adult-census-income>`_ or 
`arXiv <https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/Cornell-University/arxiv?select=arxiv-metadata-oai-snapshot.json>`_.
In these notebooks, we walk through the steps of setting up RIME with an example dataset/model;
we run Stress Testing and then the AI Firewall.

We also provide a lightweight template so that you can easily plug in your own dataset and model.
