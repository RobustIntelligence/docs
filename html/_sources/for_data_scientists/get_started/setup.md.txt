# Setup

In order to run RIME, you need do three things:
1. Get your RIME cluster URL
2. Create an API token in the UI
3. Install the RIME SDK

## Cluster URL

The first order of business is figuring out the cluster URL for your RIME cluster. This is the URL
at which you will view your results, and is also used to upload your results. It is usually in the
form `rime.{}.rime.dev`. If you have any questions about what your cluster URL is, please ask your
administrator (or whoever set up the RIME cluster).


## API Token

You now need to create an API Token. This will be used to connect programatically to the RIME cluster.
Creating this API Token is done via the UI. Go to `Settings` -> `API Access Tokens` and create your own 
token. Make sure to write this down.

## Install the RIME SDK

The RIME SDK is a Python package for interacting with RIME programmatically. This SDK is available
on pypi, so it can easily be installed with `pip install rime-sdk`. This will install the most recent
version of the RIME SDK. If your cluster is on an older version of RIME, you can install that specific
version with `pip install rime-sdk==X.Y.Z`.
