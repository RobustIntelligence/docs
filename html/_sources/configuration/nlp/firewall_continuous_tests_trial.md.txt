AI Firewall Continuous Tests Trial
=============================

To give you a sense of the capabilities of Firewall Continuous Tests without making you upload multiple datasets, we've created a trial-specific command that will allow you to simulate firewall continuous tests in one go.
Configuration of RIME AI Firewall Continuous Tests Trial is done through a JSON configuration file that you pass as an argument to the RIME CLI.


### Template
```python
{
  "run_name": "Run Name",                       (REQUIRED)
  "data_info": {...},                           (REQUIRED)
  "model_task": "Task Name",                    (REQUIRED)
  "continuous_info": {                          (REQUIRED)
    "bin_size": "day",                          (REQUIRED)
  },
  "prediction_info": {...}, 
  "tests_config_path": "path/to/tests/config",
  "random_seed": null,
  "workspace_name": "Default",
}
```

### Arguments

- **`run_name`**: string, ***required***

  The name under which your run will appear in the UI.

- **`data_info`**: DataInfo, ***required***

  Configuration for the data sources to use. For a reference on how to configure a datasource, see [Data Configuration](data_source.md).

- **`model_task`**: string, ***required***

  Specification of the model task. Currently, the supported values are `"Text Classification"` and `"Named Entity Recognition"`.

- **`continuous_info`**: ContinuousInfo, ***required***
    - **`bin_size`**: string, ***required***

      The time period for each firewall continuous tests run. Current accepted
      values are `"day"` and `"hour"`.

- `prediction_info`: PredictionInfo or `null`, *default* = `null`

  Specification of how to handle model predictions for this run. For Firewall Continuous Tests predictions MUST be provided, either as separate files (in which case those should be specified in `prediction_info`, or as part of the input data files. For a guide on how to specify this info, see [NLP Prediction Configuration](prediction_info.md).

- `tests_config_path`: string or `null`, *default* = `null`

    Path to a TestSuiteConfig JSON file. If path is `null` RIME will use the
    default [TestSuiteConfig](test_suite).

- `random_seed`: int or `null`, *default* = `null`

  The random seed to use for the run.

- `workspace_name`: string, *default* = `"Default"`

  Workspace this run should be associated with.
