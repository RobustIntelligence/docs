# Fetching Test Run Logs

Robust Intelligence can be deployed with a log archival solution that uses blob
storage. If your instance was deployed with log archival configured, when a
job fails, the control plane will push the job logs to the blob storage configured.
The logs are then accessible through a presigned url which can be retrieved using
the Python SDK. These logs are stored in blob storage for 7 days by default, although the
presigned url may expire before that depending on the configuration of the blob storage.

In order to view your logs, you can use the following commands on a completed job:

```python
    job.get_status()
    job.get_job_debug_logs_link()
```
