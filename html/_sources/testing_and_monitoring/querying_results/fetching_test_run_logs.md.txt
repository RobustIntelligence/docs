# Fetching Test Run Logs

You can deploy the Robust Intelligence agent with a log archival solution
that captures logs for failed jobs and archives them to blob storage.

## Enable the log archival feature

To set this up, follow the "Log Archival Setup" steps in the
[Installation instructions](../../deployment/installation.rst).

## View logs

Logs are accessible through a pre-signed URL that you can retrieve using
the Python SDK. These logs are stored in blob storage for 7 days by default, although the
pre-signed URL may expire before that, depending on the configuration of the blob storage.

To view your logs, run the following commands on a completed job:

```python
    job.get_status()
    job.get_job_debug_logs_link()
```
