# Viewing Test Run Progress

After kicking off a [Stress Test](../validating_models.rst) or [Continuous Testing](../monitoring_models.rst) job, it is natural to want to check the progress
of that job. Currently, Robust Intelligence only shows test run progress and status in the UI for stress
test jobs. However, it exposes a way to programmatically monitor the progress of both
stress testing and continuous testing jobs.

When kicking off a stress test with the Python SDK (`job = rime_client.start_stress_test`) the object returned is
a `Job` which can be used to monitor progress. `job.get_status()` will return the current progress of the job,
and `job.get_status(wait_until_finish=True, verbose=True)` will continue outputting the progress of the job every 5 seconds
until the job completes.

To get the current progress of a job:

```python
job.get_status()
```

To continuously get the progress of a job:

```python
job.get_status(wait_until_finish=True, verbose=True)
```

You can do the same for a continuous test that you have just kicked off.

For full documentation on what a `Job` is and how else it can be used, please see [the reference documentation](../../reference/python-sdk.rst).
