=================================================

Continuous Testing (CT) allows you to schedule your :ref:`model
tests<model-tests>` and get alerts about vulnerabilities in your model in a
continuous fashion.

There are :doc:`multiple ways to load data<preparing_your_models_and_datasets/data_source>`
to a CT instance.  Moreover, you can either manually load data at a cadence or
set up scheduling within Robust Intelligence itself.

The walkthrough below shows how to set up CT to ingest and run tests on new
data from S3 at a daily cadence.
