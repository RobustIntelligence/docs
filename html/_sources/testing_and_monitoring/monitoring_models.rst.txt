Scheduled Stress Testing
=========================

Scheduled Stress Testing allows you to schedule your :ref:`model
tests<model-tests>` and get alerts about vulnerabilities in your model in a
continual fashion.

Before you set up a stress test schedule, you must :doc:`create a stress test<validating_models/stress_tests_from_sdk>`.
There are :doc:`multiple ways to load data<preparing_your_models_and_datasets/data_source>`
for your test.  Moreover, you can either manually load data at a cadence or
set up scheduling within Robust Intelligence itself.

The walkthrough below shows how to set up stress testing to ingest and run tests on new
data from S3 at a regular cadence.

You can view stress test results in the Robust Intelligence UI.
