Monitor Models with Continuous Tests
=================================================

Continuous Testing (CT) allows you to schedule your
:ref:`model tests<model-tests>` and get alerts about
vulnerabilities in your model in a continuous fashion.

A production AI service often requires regular maintenance to support model upgrades, new training data, and other improvements. This section demonstrates how to update your Continuous Test, configure how tests are run, and update the alerts and notifications settings.

There are multiple ways to load data to the CT instance. You can either manually load data at a cadence, or set up scheduling within Robust Intelligence itself.
Below are walkthroughs and guides on loading data into your CT instance for production model monitoring.

Continuous tests run at your desired interval to identify model risk.
Test results appear in the Continuous Testing panel of the Robust
Intelligence UI.
