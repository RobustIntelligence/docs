Notifications and Alerts
=========================

Notifications allow data scientists to be notified whenever an important event has occured, for example when a job
has completed or when a monitor detects a degradation event during Continuous Testing. Notifications can be configured
to be sent to a Slack channel, an email address, or a webhook.

To get started, here are the types of notifications that are currently supported:
