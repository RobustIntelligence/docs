Validate Models with Stress Tests
=================================================

Stress Testing (ST) measures the robustness of your model by running
dozens of pre-configured :ref:`model tests<model-tests>`. Each test
checks the model's vulnerability to a specific form of potential
failure in production.

To begin running a stress test from the :ref:`SDK <rime-sdk>`, ensure
that you have first :ref:`registered your model and datasets
<preparing_your_models_and_datasets>`, refer to the following guide:

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1

   validating_models/stress_tests_from_sdk.md

Each stress test requires a specific configuration, referred to as a test run config, which allows users to specify parameters such as which datasets to use, the model task being tested, or a specific Managed Image to run the test. Stress test configurations can be set at the project level, where each test run in the project will use the same configuration, or at the test level. For instructions on specifying the test run config in the :ref:`SDK <rime-sdk>`, refer to the following guide:
