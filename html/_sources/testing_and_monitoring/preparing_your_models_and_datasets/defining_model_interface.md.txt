# Defining a Model interface

Robust Intelligence expects models to be passed in as Python files that expose one of the following functions:

- `predict_dict`: the input is a single row in dictionary form (e.g. `x = {'Age': 15,
  'Animal': 'Cat', ...}`). The return type will depend on the model task. For example,
  the output for binary classification should be a float value between 0 and 1, and
  for regression it can be an unbounded float. The function signature for either case
  should look like: `predict_dict(x: dict) -> float`. For multi-class classification
  the output should be a numpy array where the i'th element represents the predicted
  probability for the i;th class. The function signature
  changes slightly to look like: `predict_dict(x: dict) -> np.ndarray`. For details on
  the prediction formats for all model tasks, see the
  [Preprocessing your Datasets](preprocessing_your_datasets.md) page.
- `predict_df`: the input is a Pandas DataFrame, and the output is a NumPy array.
  If the model task is multi-class classification or natural language inference, the
  output should be a NumPy array of floats of shape `(len(df), num_classes)`. For all
  other model tasks, the output should be a NumPy array of floats of shape `(len(df),)`,
  with each element satisfying the prediction format specifies in
    [Preprocessing your Datasets](preprocessing_your_datasets.md).
  In any case, the function signature should look like: `predict_df(df: pd.DataFrame)
  -> np.ndarray`

    NOTE: for binary classification the return type should be a single float per row which represents the probability for the positive class. It should not be an array of probabilities for each class. E.g. `predict_df` should return `[0.7, 0.1, ...]` NOT `[[0.3, 0.7], [0.9, 0.1], ...]`.

The following shows how to set up the Python interface Robust Intelligence expects for a model that can be called via loading a model binary.

## Step 1: Specify model path
Put your model binary, and any other relevant model artifacts, in the same folder as this file.
Create a constant for the path to this binary:

```
from pathlib import Path

cur_dir = Path(__file__).absolute().parent

MODEL_NAME = 'TODO: change this to model name'
MODEL_PATH = cur_dir / MODEL_NAME
```

## Step 2: Retrieve custom code
If custom code is needed to perform preprocessing on the data (or to call your API), we need to make sure it is loaded into the environment. If this code is able to be installed as a Python package, see the `Custom Requirements` section.

If your code is NOT a Python package (and is instead a Python file or folder) then please put all relevant files in the same directory as this file, and add the following snippet to the Python file:
```
import sys
sys.path.append(str(cur_dir))
```

## Step 3: Access the model

As an example, if you used the Python `pickle` module to save your model this would look like:
```
import pickle
with open(MODEL_PATH, 'rb') as f:
    model = pickle.load(f)
```

## Step 4: Import / implement preprocessing function

If the model you are using expects inputs of a different schema than the datasets you've provided, or of a different type than `dict`/`Pandas.DataFrame`, you will need to load/define all custom preprocessing. If your model can take in the raw data directly then you can skip this step! Getting the preprocessing functionality could look like:
```
from custom_package import preprocessing
```
or
```
def preprocessing(x: dict) -> ModelInputType:
    # TODO: implement preprocessing logic.
```

## Step 5: Implement a predict function
Implement either the `predict_dict` function or the `predict_df` function. For binary classification, this should look something like:

(NOTE: whichever you choose to implement, it must match one of the function names and signatures below.)
```
# In multi-class case, the return type is np.ndarray
def predict_dict(x: dict) -> float:
    single_input = preprocessing(x)
    model_output = model.predict_proba(single_input)
    return model_output[0][1]
```
OR
```
def predict_df(df: pd.DataFrame) -> np.ndarray:
    array_input = preprocessing(df)
    model_output = model.predict_proba(array_input)
    return model_output[:, 1]
```
