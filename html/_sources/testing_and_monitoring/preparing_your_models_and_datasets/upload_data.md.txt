# Uploading to Cloud Storage (Optional)

You can use the SDK to upload data files and model directories to a S3 bucket that Robust Intelligence has permission
to use (See [Data Access Permissions](../../deployment/requirements/data_access_permissions.md) for instructions).
All files uploaded will be stored in a subdirectory within the `files` directory.

## Uploading Data Files

{{ sdk_client_setup }}

Afterwards, use the `rime_client.upload_file` method to upload data.

When the `upload_path` is not specified, the path contains a random string as directory name.
```python
ref_path = rime_client.upload_file(file_path="./titanic/datasets/train.csv")
print("ref_path:", ref_path)
"ref_path: s3://rime-blob-c78976e9367daf-environment/files/84f82c37-0d8f-43af-8d05-76jknwefnjkm/data/train.csv"
```

When the `upload_path` is  specified, the path contains the `upload_path` string in place of the random string.
```python
ref_path = rime_client.upload_file(file_path="./titanic/datasets/train.csv", upload_path="rime_tests/titanic_tests")
print("ref_path:", ref_path)
"ref_path: s3://rime-blob-c78976e9367daf-environment/files/rime_tests/titanic_tests/data/train.csv"
```

## Uploading Images

Robust Intelligence expects image dataset files as a list of JSON dictionaries with keys specified in the `image_features` parameter that each reference an image by an absolute or relative path.
Each image in the dataset file is uploaded to the Robust Intelligence cluster's storage.

Use `rime_client.upload_local_image_dataset_file` to upload an image dataset file containing paths to images stored locally. When your image paths already reference external blob storage, use `upload_file`.

When the `upload_path` is not specified, the path contains a random string as directory name.
```python
_, img_dataset_path = rime_client.upload_local_image_dataset_file(file_path="./titanic/images.tgz", image_features=["Image Path"])
print("img_dataset_path:", img_dataset_path)
"img_dataset_path: s3://rime-blob-c78976e9367daf-environment/files/84f82c37-0d8f-43af-8d05-76jknwefnjkm/data/images.tgz"
```

When the `upload_path` is  specified, the path contains the `upload_path` string in place of the random string.
```python
_, img_dataset_path = rime_client.upload_local_image_dataset_file(file_path="./titanic/images.tgz", image_features=["Image Path"], upload_path="rime_tests/titanic_tests")
print("img_dataset_path:", img_dataset_path)
"img_dataset_path: s3://rime-blob-c78976e9367daf-environment/files/rime_tests/titanic_tests/data/images.tgz"
```

## Uploading Model Directories

The model directory is a directory containing the `model.py` file and any
extras, such as pre-processing code or the pickle file, that the `model.py`  file depends on.

Model directories can easily be uploaded using the `rime_client.upload_directory` method.

When the `upload_path` is not specified, the path contains a random string as directory name.
```python
model_dir = rime_client.upload_directory(dir_path="./titanic/model")
print("model_dir:", model_dir)
"model_dir: s3://rime-blob-c78976e9367daf-environment/files/c83aa17d-709b-48b5-89ed-a9e4bad42f0b/model"
```

When the `upload_path` is  specified, the path contains the `upload_path` string in place of the random string.
```python
model_dir = rime_client.upload_directory(dir_path="./titanic/model", upload_path="rime_tests/titanic_tests")
print("model_dir:", model_dir)
"model_dir: s3://rime-blob-c78976e9367daf-environment/files/rime_tests/titanic_tests/model"
```
