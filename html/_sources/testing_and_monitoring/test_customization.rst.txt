Test Customization
=================================================

Once you're familiar with running Stress and Continuous Tests in your Robust Intelligence installation, you can increase the flexibility and capability of Robust Intelligence testing with the material discussed here.


Custom Metrics allow users to upload custom business metrics to be tracked by Robust Intelligence. This allows users to track these metrics alongside default ones in order to use the capabilities of Robust Intelligence to better measure the business impact of their ML deployment.

Some models may need pip or package requirements to run, and Robust Intelligence allows users to specify these requirements by creating a Managed Image. These custom docker images can then be used to run tests, and are specified in the :ref:`Runtime Info section<runtime>` of the Test Run Configuration.

Robust Intelligence also offers the ability to add user-specified custom tests to the test suite. This is useful for adding testing for your models that is not covered by the standard tests, and is available as a beta feature. Contact RI support for help setting up custom tests for your Robust Intelligence installation.
