Querying Test Run Results
=========================

Besides viewing Robust Intelligence test results in the web application, you may use the Python SDK to retrieve data that can be programmatically parsed. This functionality is very helpful for incorporating Robust Intelligence into your production model/data pipelines. For instance, if you are interested in the results of a specific feature, test, or statistic, you can fetch stress testing results from the backend and write code to make decisions (e.g. whether to deploy the model) based on the results.

During test runs, you can query for the progress of the test run using the following guide:

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1

   querying_results/test_run_progress.md

Once a test run is complete, you can query for the results of the test run using the following guide:

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1

   querying_results/test_run_results.md

If a test run is marked as *FAILED*, you can view logs for the failed job using the following guide:

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1

   querying_results/fetching_test_run_logs.md
