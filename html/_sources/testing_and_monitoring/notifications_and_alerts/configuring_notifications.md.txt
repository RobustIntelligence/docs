# Configuring Notifications

## Setting up Project Alerts

1.  Sign in to a Robust Intelligence instance.
    >   The Workspaces page appears.
2.  Click a workspace.
    >   The Workspaces summary page appears.
3.  Select a project.
    >   You can filter or sort the list of projects in a workspace with the
    >   *Sort* and *Filter* controls in the upper right. Click the glyph to the
    >   right of the *Filter* control to switch between list and card display
    >   for projects. Type a string in *Search Projects...* to display only
    >   projects that match the string.

    >   The project overview page appears.
4.  Click *Alerts* next to the project name.
    >   The Project Alerts dialog box appears.
6.  Choose an alert delivery model.
    >   | Alert delivery | Configuration step                                             |
    >   |----------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
    >   | Email          | In *Email Address*, type an email address and click *Add*.     |
    >   | Slack          | In *Webhook URL*, paste the Slack webhook URL and click *Add*. |
7.  Click *Done*.

Alerts are configured for this project.

## How to Configure Email Notifications

* Email notifications depend on Robust Intelligence having a properly [configured SMTP server](../../administration/organization_administration/configuring_smtp.md).

* Email addresses can be added by clicking on the alerts icon for a particular project in the web app or calling a method in the SDK.

  ```python
  project = rime_client.get_project("<your_project_id_here")
  # Strings for the type of the notification to sign up for are:
  # ["Job_Action", "Monitoring", "Daily_Digest"]
  project.add_email("<your_email_here>", "Monitoring")
  ```

* Currently, Gmail and Outlook are the only officially supported email clients.

* Email notifications are supported for Enterprise customers and Cloud Trial customers.

    * Enterprise customers will need to configure SMTP with their own server. SMTP settings live under workspace settings.

    * Cloud Trial customers will receive emails from “dev@robustintelligence.com”. Add this email address to your safe senders list to prevent it from going to spam.

* Emails can be removed from a project in the web app or the SDK.

  ```python
  project = rime_client.get_project("<your_project_id_here")
  project.remove_email("<your_email_here>")
  ```

## How to Configure Webhooks

* Arbitrary webhook URLs may be added by clicking the alerts icon for a particular project on the web app or by calling a method in the SDK.

  ```python
  project = rime_client.get_project("<your_project_id_here")
  # Strings for the type of the notification to sign up for are:
  # ["Job_Action", "Monitoring", "Daily_Digest"]
  project.add_webhook("<your_webhook_url_here", "Job_Action")
  ```
* Webhook URLs should be preauthenticated (i.e. include a security token as a URL parameter).
  After you create a webhook from another application to copy-paste into the RI Platform, ensure
  that you do not share that webhook publicly.

* Webhooks can be removed from a project in the web app or the SDK.

  ```python
  project = rime_client.get_project("<your_project_id_here")
  project.remove_webhook("<your_webhook_url_here")
  ```

## How to Configure Slack Notifications

* Incoming webhooks are the preferred way to integrate Slack and Robust Intelligence.

* Create an Incoming Webhook Slack App using the instructions [here](https://api.slack.com/messaging/webhooks).

* Use the instructions for configuring webhooks above to add your created webhook to your project of choice.

* Thresholds can also be modified in the SDK.

  ```python
  project = rime_client.get_project("<your_project_id_here")
  firewall = project.get_firewall()

  # Get a pd.DataFrame with the current thresholds.
  df = firewall.get_metric_thresholds()

  # Disable the threshold for "Abnormality Rate"
  firewall.update_metric_thresholds("Abnormality Rate", disabled=True)
  ```
