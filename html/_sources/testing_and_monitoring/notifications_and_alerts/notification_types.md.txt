# Notification Types

All the following types of notifications are configured at the Project level via Project Settings.
You are not limited to one notification type: any subset of the following types can be selected.

## Job Action Notifications
* Triggered during key status changes in the life cycle of a testing job, such as completion or failure.
* Useful for long-running test runs, Stress Tests or Continuous Tests, with large datasets / complex models

## Daily Digest Notifications
* Include a summary of all Stress Test runs for the day.
* Will NOT be sent if there are no Stress Tests for the day.
* Sent out every day at 8am in the timezone configured
  for the Organization (initialized to UTC).

## Events (Monitoring) Notifications

> Note: please check with your admin if the Monitoring feature is turned on for your organization

* Preferred means of tracking model health over time.
* Triggered when a Continuous Testing job completes and has detected Events for
  the set of Monitors with enabled notifications.
  * A Monitor tracks model degradations over time; events are created when the Monitor
    detects a serious problem. See the [reference](../monitoring_models/ct_feedback_and_observability.md) for
    more information about Monitors and Events.
  * By default, only an important subset of the Default Monitors have notifications enabled
    to avoid spamming you.
* Choose between receiving notifications at different Alert levels.
  * `ONLY_ALERTS` will only send a notification if there are Events with Alert severity.
  * `WARNINGS_AND_ALERTS` will send notification if any Events are detected.
