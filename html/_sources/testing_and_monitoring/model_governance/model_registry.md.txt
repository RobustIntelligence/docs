# Model Registry

Once you've [registered a model](../preparing_your_models_and_datasets/registering_model_datasets.md)
in Robust Intelligence, it appears in the Models Panel with summary
status information. You can view more detailed information about the
model and its risk in the Model Info panel.

## Check the Risk Status of a Registered Model

To view the registered models in a project and see their latest risk status, follow these steps:

1. Sign in to a Robust Intelligence instance or click *Workspaces* in
   the right navigation panel.
1. In the Workspaces page, click the name of your workspace.
1. From the list of projects, click on the name of your project.
1. In the left navigation panel, click on *Model Registry*.

The Models panel shows the models currently registered or pending registration in this project.

The Model Info panel shows the following aspects of your registered model:

- **Model Info** shows your model's registration parameters including its
  Name, Model ID (click the copy icon to copy the model's UUID),
  Integration, Model Endpoint Integration, Model Path (click the copy
  icon to copy the model's path), Model status (Validation or
  Production), External ID, Registration Status, Registration Date,
  and Registered By (person who registered the model). See
  [Registering Models](../preparing_your_models_and_datasets/registering_model_datasets.md)
  for more information.
- **Model alerts**: Provides a link to the **Events list**, where you
  can view this model's alerts in this project.
- **Stress test runs**: Provides a link to the **Stress Testing**
  panel, where you can view this model's stress test runs in this
  project.
- **Production test history**: Provides a link to the **Continuous
  Testing** panel, where you can view this model's continuous test
  runs in this project.
- **Latest Risk Overview** shows the Operational, Fairness, and
  Security risk assessments from the latest test run. See
