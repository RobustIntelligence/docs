The Events table displays a list of all events associated with tests failures in the project.
* Clicking on an event, navigates you to further details about the testing failure.
* Clicking **Resolve** on the Event removes that Event from the table.
* The table can be filtered or sorted by Severity or Risk Category Type to prioritize displaying specific events.

### Project Information

The Project Info provides high level information about the project. This project information can be edited via the Project Settings tab in the left sidebar. The project information contains:
* Project Description
* Model tasks associated with project
* Project Owner

### Production Model

The Production Model info provides high level information about the production model. This cannot be edited. The production model information contains:
* Model Task
* Model Owner
* Created Date
* Last Model Output - the date-timestamp of the model's last prediction
* Reference Dataset - the dataset the production model was trained on
* Model Cards - navigates to [model card builder](model_cards.md) for production model

### Operational Risk
