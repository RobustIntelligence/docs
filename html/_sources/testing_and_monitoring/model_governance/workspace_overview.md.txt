### Project Information Summary

Project information is also available in the table at the bottom of the page, which summarizes the following project details:
* Project name
* Description
* Status (Production or Validation)
* Operational Risk (Pass, Warning, or Alert)
* Security Risk (Pass, Warning, or Alert)
* Fairness Risk (Pass, Warning, or Alert)
* Last Activity
* Model task
* Model owner

The table can be filtered or sorted to prioritize specific project information.

### Configuring the ring chart

A ring chart at the upper left summarizes the projects in the workspace by their assigned tag,
enabling projects to be grouped together. Projects can be grouped by:
1. Status
2. Operational Risk
3. Security Risk
4. Fairness Risk
5. Model task


### Configuring the project metric chart

In the upper right, a project metric chart enables you to compare several aspects across projects.

1. From the *Projects* drop-down, select a set of projects to compare (up to 5). To compare projects, the projects need to have a shared metric and bin size.
2. From the *Metric* drop-down, choose a metric to compare.
3. From the *Aggregation* drop-down, select an aggregation type.
    >   *   *None* performs no aggregation.
    >   *   *Sum, selected projects* aggregates projects by the sum of the chosen metric.
    >   *   *Average, selected projects* aggregates projects by the average of the chosen metric.
4. Select a time interval (*Latest Bucket* can be selected to show results only for the latest data bucket).

The project metric chart updates according to the selections.
