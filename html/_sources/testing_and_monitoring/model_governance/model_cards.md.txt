# Model Cards

A model card is a document summarizing the capabilities, datasets, limitations, and training parameters for a given machine learning model. Robust Intelligence enables you to generate configurable model cards directly from your test runs, helping you instantly share transparent model information within your team and with external stakeholders.

## Launching the Model Card Builder

Model cards are generated by the Model Card Builder, which can be accessed in the Robust Intelligence web UI through the following steps:

1.  Sign in to a Robust Intelligence instance.
    >   The Workspaces page appears.
2.  Select a workspace.
    >   The Workspace Overview page appears, listing the projects in that workspace.
3.  Select a project.
    >   The Project Overview page appears.
4.  At the bottom of the Production Model pane at the right, click *Go to Builder*.
    >   The Model Card Builder launches.

You can also launch the Model Card Builder directly from Project Settings page or via the model card icon in the test run table on the Stress Testing page.

## Generating model cards with the Model Card Builder.

This procedure presumes you have launched the Model Card Builder. To edit model and business impact metadata, go to [Project Settings](../creating_projects/manage_projects.md).

1. Select severity toggles from the *Model Issue Severities* section of the left
    column.
   >  The severity levels are Alert, Warning, and Passing.
2. Select a set of test type toggles to include in the model card.
   >  The model card can include Stress Testing, Continuous Testing, or both.
3. (Stress Testing selected) Select a set of test categories in each risk category.
   >  The risk categories are Operational Risk, Security Risk, and Ethical Risk.
   >  Security tests contain additional details in the model card: Effect on model, Possible intent, Recommendations
4. (Continuous Testing selected) Select a set of test categories in each risk category.
   >  The risk categories are Operational Risk, Security Risk, and Ethical Risk.
   >  Security tests contain additional details in the model card: Effect on model, Possible intent, Evidence, Recommendations
5. If desired, Model Overview and Business Impact information can be edited in Project Settings by selecting *Edit model information in Project Settings* under *Model Information*. Type information into the following data fields and save:
   >  Ethical Considerations
   >  Intended Uses
6. *(If Edit Project Setting selected)* At the bottom of the Production Model pane at the right, click *Go to Builder*.
   >  The Model Card Builder launches.
7. Type information into the following data fields.
   >  Title and Subtitle
   >  About Data Collection
8. Select test case details via the test case summary tables to be included in the model card. Depending on model task and test type, there may be some tests that do not generate charts. Note that including test case details makes the model card content substantially longer and therefore increases generation time.
9. Choose an output format from the *Export to...* drop-down selector and click the *Export* button.
   >  Export format options are JSON and PDF.
   >  Note that there is a maximum size limit for exporting in PDF format. You will be notified when you have exceeded the maximum limit. JSON export format has no size limit.

The model card is saved to local storage in the selected format.
