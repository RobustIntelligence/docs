# Row Sampling

When running a test, Robust Intelligence can load the number of rows
you specify, or it can automatically load the largest sample of rows
that will fit in memory.

## Specifying how many rows will be loaded in a test run

There are three options for configuring the number of rows to be
loaded in your test runs:

- [Use Smart Dataset Sampling](#use-smart-dataset-sampling)
- [Load a specific number of rows](#load-a-specific-number-of-rows)
- [Load all rows](#load-all-rows)

### Use Smart Dataset Sampling

If a dataset cannot be contained in memory because it exceeds
[data loading limits](#data-loading-limits), Robust Intelligence can be
configured to load the largest sample of rows that will fit in memory.
To set this up, edit your
[data_params configuration](../preparing_your_models_and_datasets/data_source.md#dataset-sizing)
as follows:
- set `sample` to `true`
- leave `nrows` undefined

See [Smart Dataset Sampling](#smart-dataset-sampling).

### Load a specific number of rows

If you wish to specify the number of rows to load, edit your
[data_params configuration](../preparing_your_models_and_datasets/data_source.md#dataset-sizing)
as follows:
- set `sample` to `true`
- set `nrows` to the number of rows you wish to load

Robust Intelligence uses [reservoir sampling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reservoir_sampling)
to choose which rows to sample.

### Load all rows

To load all rows of your dataset, edit your
[data_params configuration](../preparing_your_models_and_datasets/data_source.md#dataset-sizing)
as follows:
- set `sample` to `false`
- leave `nrows` undefined


## Smart Dataset Sampling

Smart Dataset Sampling reads a subset of your dataset in order to
assess how much memory it requires. We extrapolate the maximal dataset
that can be loaded into memory based on this assessed size and the
total memory available.


### How Smart Dataset Sampling Works

If your configuration doesnâ€™t specify the
[number of rows to be sampled (nrows)](../preparing_your_models_and_datasets/data_source.md#dataset-sizing),
then Robust Intelligence chooses a default sample size using the steps
outlined in the example below.

For this example, we assume a dataset of 1 million rows.

1. We load a batch of 65,000 rows from the dataset into memory in order to
   assess the size of the batch in memory.
1. We calculate the number of rows that will fit in available memory:
   - *Job Memory Requested* is the memory you request in your configuration.
     If you don't specify a value, this defaults to 8 GiB.
   - *Used Memory* is the memory currently being used by the node (depending
     on current jobs running)
   - *Buffer memory* is always 1.5 GiB
   - *Batch memory* is the amount of memory that was needed for the
     65,000-row sample loaded in step 1
   - the *Number of Batches* is calculated as:
     ```
     Number of Batches = (Job Memory Requested - Used Memory - Buffer Memory) / Batch Memory
     ```
1. Using the above values, we calculate the number of rows to sample:
   ```
   Number of Rows = Number of Batches * 65000
   ```
1. Once we've calculated how many rows we'll sample, we use
   [reservoir sampling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reservoir_sampling)
   to choose which rows to sample.

### FAQ on Smart Dataset Sampling

#### What if I specify a number of features to use?

Smart Dataset Sampling can work in conjunction with Smart Feature
Sampling. If you have set up [Smart Feature Sampling](feature_sampling.md)
with a threshold *k* of features, then we load only the top *k* most
important features when loading sample rows to calculate the batch
memory.


## Data Loading Limits

The following tables show Robust Intelligence's limits with respect to
data in CSV format. Once these limits are reached, data will be sampled
using [Smart Dataset Sampling](#smart-dataset-sampling).

See the [memory recommendations](performance.md#memory-recommendations)
in the Performance section for sizing guidelines.
