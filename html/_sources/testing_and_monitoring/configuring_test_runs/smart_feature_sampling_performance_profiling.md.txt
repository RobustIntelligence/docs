# Smart Feature Sampling and Other Performance Optimizations

## Smart Feature Sampling
For large datasets, Robust Intelligence can be optimized by running on a subset of features.
This works by specifying the number of features to test on. Robust Intelligence automatically calculates feature
importances in both the with-model case and without-model case (as long as labels or predictions are provided),
and runs its suite of tests across the most important features.

To set up smart feature sampling, specify the `num_feats_to_profile` option in the `data_profiling` parameter.
The maximum number of features that Robust Intelligence can be run on is 750.

More information can be found in [Data Profiling Configuration](data_profiling.md).

## Profile Caching
Robust Intelligence must understand properties of the datasets and models before tests can be performed.
These are called profiles.  Since it is common to run Robust Intelligence multiple times over the same datasets and models,
these profiles are cached and then re-used to make subsequent runs faster.  For example, the same datasets might
be used to evaluate multiple models. In this case, the dataset profiles will not be recomputed for the second run or any run after that.

Caching is specific to each unique dataset/model ID. Therefore it is best to re-use datasets and models and not
re-register them where it is not necessary. This will allow subsequent runs to be faster.
On the flip-side, the cache can be purposely avoided and refreshed by re-registering your data.

## Smart Dataset Sampling

If a dataset cannot be contained in memory, Robust Intelligence will attempt to take and process as large of a sample as
possible that will fit in memory. This is done by first reading in a subset of data and seeing how much
memory it takes up. The maximal dataset that can be in memory is then extrapolated based on this number and the
total memory available.

The following tables show Robust Intelligence's limits in reference to data in CSV format.
Once these limits are hit the data will be sampled.
