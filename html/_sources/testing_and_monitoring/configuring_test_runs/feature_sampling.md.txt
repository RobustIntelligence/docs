# Feature Sampling

## Smart Feature Sampling

For large datasets, Robust Intelligence can be optimized by running on
a subset of features. This works by specifying the number of features
that will be evaluated during the test.

Robust Intelligence automatically calculates feature importances in
both the with-model case and without-model case (as long as labels or
predictions are provided), and runs its suite of tests across the most
important features.

### Configuration

To turn on smart feature sampling, specify the
[num_feats_to_profile](configuring_data_profiling.md#data-profiling-arguments)
setting in the `data_profiling` configuration. For details,
see [Data Profiling Configuration](configuring_data_profiling.md).

### How Smart Feature Sampling works

- You specify your desired threshold *k* of features.
- Robust Intelligence loads only the top *k* features, by feature
  importance. An upper threshold of 750 features is enforced.
- After computing the top *k* features, Robust Intelligence adds
  protected feature pairs, custom intersections, projected columns,
  and embedding columns if they arenâ€™t present in the top *k* features
  that were already slated for loading.


### FAQ on Smart Feature Sampling

#### Can I also specify the number of rows to load?

Yes. Smart Feature Sampling can work in conjunction with Smart Dataset
Sampling. See [Smart Dataset Sampling](row_sampling.md#smart-dataset-sampling).
