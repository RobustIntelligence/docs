# Configuring Projects

The project settings page enables you to modify the following configuration aspects:

* Project configuration
* Configuration of the model used by the project
* Configuration of the test runs for the model
* Configuration of the actual tests run on the model

## Configuring Continuous Testing Data Sources and Scheduling

This procedure assumes data sources have already been configured. Consult the section
on configuring an [integration](../../administration/workspace_configuration/integrations/configuring_integrations.md) for details.

1.  Sign in to a Robust Intelligence instance.
    >   The Workspaces page appears.
2.  Click a workspace.
    >   The Workspaces summary page appears.
3.  Select a project.
    >   You can filter or sort the list of projects in a workspace with the
    >   *Sort* and *Filter* controls in the upper right. Click the glyph to the
    >   right of the *Filter* control to switch between list and card display
    >   for projects. Type a string in *Search Projects...* to display only
    >   projects that match the string.

    >   The project overview page appears.
4.  Click the *Project Settings* gear icon on the left navigation bar.
    >   The project settings page appears.
5.  Click the *Test Configuration* tab at the top.
6.  The Test Configuration page opens at the Categories and Sensitivity pane.
7.  From the left sidebar, click *Continuous Test data and schedule*.
    >   The Continuous Test data and schedule pane appears.
8.  In *Connection*, choose a configured data source.
9.  In *Table Name*, choose a table name.
10. Select columns from the *Timestamp Column*, *Label Column*, and *Prediction Column*
    drop-down selectors.
11. In *Continuous Testing Schedule*, select a bin size, a rolling window, and a number
    of bins.
12. Click *Save Settings*.

Robust Intelligence saves the configuration settings for data sources and scheduling.

## Configuring Individual Tests

You can configure individual tests within a project.

9.  Click the pencil icon next to a test.
    >   The Advanced Configuration pane for that test displays.
10. Choose where to run the test.
    >   A specific test can run in Stress Testing, Continuous Testing, or both.
11. In *Severity Thresholds*, enter values and define conditions for each alert level.
    >   The Robust Intelligence instance generates an event each time the test result meets the value and condition.
12. Select an on-save action.
    >   Update Current Run Settings & Thresholds applies the new values to a testing run that is already in progress.

    >   Update Project Settings saves the values to the project and applies the new values to any future test runs.
13. Click *Save Updates*.
    >   The Individual Test Configuration pane appears.
14. Click *Save Settings*.

Robust Intelligence saves the updated individual test configuration.

## Configuring Data Profiling

Robust Intelligence instances perform [data profiling](./configuring_data_profiling.md) and
modify test runs according to the results.

    >   *Sort* and *Filter* controls in the upper right. Click the glyph to the
    >   right of the *Filter* control to switch between list and card display
    >   for projects. Type a string in *Search Projects...* to display only
    >   projects that match the string.

    >   The project overview page appears.
4.  Click the *Project Settings* gear icon on the left navigation bar.
