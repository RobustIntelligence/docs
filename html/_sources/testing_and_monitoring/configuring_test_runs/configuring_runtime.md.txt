# Configuring Runtime Information

A `run_time_info` object tells Robust Intelligence what system resources
to use when running your test job.

By default, Robust Intelligence attempts to infer optimal values for
the `run_time_info` settings. You should only opt for manually setting
these parameters if you find that Robust Intelligence is not selecting
appropriate values.

If you choose to set your `run_time_info` manually, you can set it in
one of the following ways:

- Save it in your [project](../../reference/python-sdk.rst#rime_sdk.Project.update_run_time_info); or
- Pass it in the
  [stress testing configuration](../validating_models/configuring_stress_tests.md)
  when you [run a test](../validating_models/stress_tests_from_sdk.md).

### `run_time_info` object

Below, we show an example `run_time_info` object:

```python
# values shown below are not defaults, but rather examples of how to specify configuration.
{
    #...,
    "run_time_info": {
      "agent_id": "my_agent_id",
      "custom_image": {
        # either this:
        "custom_image": {
          "name": "my custom image name",
          "pull_secret": "my custom image pull secret",
        },
        # or this:
        "managed_image_name": "my managed image name",
      },
      "resource_request": {
        "ram_request_megabytes": 1,
        "cpu_request_millicores": 1,
      },
      "explicit_errors": False,
      "random_seed": 5
    }
}
```

### Attributes of the `run_time_info` object

- `agent_id`: string, *default* = the ID of the default agent for the workspace.

  The ID of the agent on which to run this job. If not specified, the job will run on the default agent for the workspace.

- `custom_image`: dict, *default* = `null`

  Specifies a custom Docker image used by the job. In the outer `custom_image`
  dictionary, specify exactly one of `managed_image_name` or the inner `custom_image`
  dictionary. For more information on specifying custom images, see [Running Tests on Managed Docker Images](run_tests_on_managed_images.md).

- `resource_request`: dict, *default* = `null`

  The compute resources, such as RAM and CPU, that the job requires. If you leave this parameter unspecified, Robust Intelligence will attempt to infer the optimal values for your job.

  To learn more about memory and CPU settings, see [Performance](performance.md).

- `explicit_errors`: boolean, *default* = `False`

  Specifies whether runtime errors that occur within Robust Intelligence tests will be explicitly raised, interrupting the entire test run. By default, this parameter is set to false, meaning that errors within a single test will not stop the test run.

- `random_seed`: string, *default* = None

  Random seed (int64 encoded as a string) for the job to ensure deterministic results. If not specified, the random seed will not be set.
