Loading Data for Scheduled Continuous Testing
=============================================

Delta Lake
---------------------------------------------

Robust Intelligence has native integration with Databricks Deltalake, a popular data storage system used for big data analytics.
If your data is stored in Deltalake, you can easily register an integration by providing the necessary credentials in the workspace settings page.
Once this integration is set up, you can specify the location of your data stored in Deltalake and schedule a Continuous Test to pull the data from this configured source as required.

Data Collector
---------------------------------------------

When running a production AI service, it is important to keep records of your inputs and associated outputs via some form of logging.
Once you have deployed a Continuous Testing instance for your production model, you can log datapoints to the Robust Intelligence Data Collector and schedule routine or manual runs on your data.
Using the Data Collector enables to abstract away the collection of these logs and enables RI to easily analyze these logs in production using Continuous Testing.
The example notebook provided demonstrates this in action.

Custom Loader
---------------------------------------------

Users of Robust Intelligence may have unique data storage patterns that require customized integration. To support these use cases, Robust Intelligence provides a custom loader format that allows users to specify logic for loading data from a generic location in a Python file.
This custom loader can then be used to pull data for scheduled Continuous Tests. Using the custom loader to connect to an external data source allows for easy integration into any widely available commercial cloud storage framework.
