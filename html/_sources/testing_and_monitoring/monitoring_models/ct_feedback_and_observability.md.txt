# Continuous Testing Feedback and Observability

Once a model is in production, Robust Intelligence can provide detailed information on the model's
performance to enable you to identify and correct issues.

## Model monitors

A model under Continuous Testing displays summary information about model health on the
Overview page of the project that contains the model. Robust Intelligence monitors machine learning
model performance across the following three risk categories:

* **Operational** tests a model's overall performance and data stability of over time.
* **Security** tests a model's resilience against compromise from external attacks.
* **Fairness** tests a model's outcome for fair treatment among subsets in the data.

### Viewing the CT risk pages
1.  Sign in to a RI Platform instance.
    >   The Workspaces page appears.
2.  Click a workspace.
    >   The Workspaces summary page appears.
3.  Select a project.
    >   You can filter or sort the list of projects in a workspace with the
    >   *Sort* and *Filter* controls in the upper right. Click the glyph to the
    >   right of the *Filter* control to switch between list and card display
    >   for projects. Type a string in *Search Projects...* to display only
    >   projects that match the string.
4. Select the **Continuous Testing** tab in the left panel.
    > The CT Overview page appears
4. Click on one of the risk category tabs at the top (**Operational**, **Security**, or **Fairness**).
    > The corresponding CT risk page appears.

### Monitors and risk categories

Monitors of particular interest can be pinned to the top of the list by clicking the
pushpin icon at the top left corner of the monitor. Pinned Operational risk monitors
will also show up in the Continuous Testing Overview page. Use the **Date Range**
controls to change your view of the monitor chart. Some monitors have feature or
subset dropdown menus which allow you to view the monitored metric for a specific
feature or subset(s) of a feature in your dataset.

#### Enabling or disabling notifications for a monitor

You can enable or suppress notifications from a specified monitor.

1.  Sign in to a RI Platform instance.
    >   The Workspaces page appears.
2.  Click a workspace.
    >   The Workspaces summary page appears.
3.  Select a project.
    >   You can filter or sort the list of projects in a workspace with the
    >   *Sort* and *Filter* controls in the upper right. Click the glyph to the
    >   right of the *Filter* control to switch between list and card display
    >   for projects. Type a string in *Search Projects...* to display only
    >   projects that match the string.
    >   The project overview page appears.
4.  In the top right corner of a monitor, click **Edit Monitor**.
    >   The Edit Monitor wizard appears.

Notifications for this monitor are added or removed from the project according to the
position of the toggle.

<!-- Notification settings are managed from {TKK xref to notif/alert config} -->

## Events

The Overview page of a model under Continuous Testing displays a list of Active Events
to the right of the active monitors.

The Events list provides several filter selectors to focus on a specific set of events.

| Filter            | Description                        | Potential states                |
|-------------------|------------------------------------|---------------------------------|

| Risk Categories   | Major risk category                | Operational, Security, Fairness |
| Status            | The status of a specific test      | Fail, Warning, Pass, Skip       |
| Level             | The importance level of the event  | None, Low, High                 |
| Last Updated Time | The time an event was last updated | Within a time range             |

### Event root-cause analysis and actionability

Robust Intelligence can provide significant context and analysis of a detected event.
This analysis includes the metric and threshold values defining the event and the time
interval for which the metric fell below the thresholds. Events for degraded model
performance monitors will show which data issue(s) may have lead to the detected event
when applicable.
