Robust Intelligence ü§ù SageMaker
================================

This walkthrough will cover how to integrate AI Stress Testing and Continuous Testing
into your workflow on the SageMaker platform. For a concise example of the `model.py` file,
please reference the :ref:`SageMaker Model Provider<sagemaker>` doc.

This assumes you have already set up your SageMaker account and have a notebook instance running.

First, download the `SageMaker Walkthrough Notebook here <https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1EzM8xTxpl600yXh0xBfJw3fmfNr8WgJg>`_. Alternatively, you can view the same notebook here:

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1

   ../../../notebooks/integrations_notebooks/RIME_SageMaker_Walkthrough.ipynb

Then, from the `SageMaker Console <https://console.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker>`_, navigate to your new notebook instance and either open Jupyter and press "Upload" in the toolbar, or open JupyterLab and upload the notebook through the File Browser on the left.
