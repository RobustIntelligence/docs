Robust Intelligence ü§ù DataRobot
================================

For an end-to-end walkthrough of how Robust Intelligence integrates with and secures models developed within the DataRobot ecosystem:

In this notebook, you will see how to:

- Apply AI Stress Testing to any model developed on DataRobot.
- Query test results using the RIME SDK to ascertain the robustness of each model.
- Deploy Continuous Testing to protect and monitor your DataRobot models in production.

The walkthrough assumes that you have created a `DataRobot account <https://www.datarobot.com>`_
and have an API Key available to connect to your DataRobot environment using their SDK.

For a focused example on how to define a `model.py` file that connects with your DataRobot model, check
out the :ref:`DataRobot Model Integration<datarobot>` page.
