# Managing your Projects

A user with the appropriate permissions can configure several aspects of a project and
the tests within that project. For further information on setting test run configurations at the project level, see [Configuring Projects](../configuring_test_runs/configuring_projects.md).

## Sharing a Project

Share a project to enable other users to view the project. Users require edit-level
access to a project in order to share the project. Details on access privileges are
discussed in the section on [role-based access control](../../administration/security_and_compliance/rbac.md).

3.  Select a project.
    >   You can filter or sort the list of projects in a workspace with the
    >   *Sort* and *Filter* controls in the upper right. Click the glyph to the
    >   right of the *Filter* control to switch between list and card display
    >   for projects. Type a string in *Search Projects...* to display only
    >   projects that match the string.
