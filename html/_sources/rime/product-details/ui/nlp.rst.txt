RIME NLP UI
===============================
.. include:: shared.rst


AI Stress Testing
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Test Runs page is home to all the test results and summary metrics generated by a single run of RIME.

By default, the tests are organized by category. To alternatively sort tests by severity, toggle the view's `By Category` button, as shown in the screenshot below. You can also sort and filter the table.

The Test Runs page also enables you to easily share the results of your experiment. Click the `Download Report` button to export a summary pdf.

You can view the tests by category, and the category tabs include suggestions created from the test results.

Test Detail - Test Cases
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Clicking on a test type row will take you to the corresponding test detail page, allowing you to further investigate individual test cases.

If you click the `(i) More` button, you can read an in-depth context of the test.

Clicking on the "Configuration" tab reveals the configurations used for the test, as well as their descriptions.

Each table row corresponds to a single test case. Click to view the expanded details, which provide info on the test case and an explanation of the test outcome.

Tip: You can use `Esc` key for returning back to the list of tests/features page.


Test Detail - Resolve
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can manually resolve any test case with a `warning` status by clicking the red status button on the left side of the row. Click the `Mark All As Resolved` in the top left-hand corner of the table to resolve all rows with warnings for that test.

For example, before resolving any test case you may see something like this.

After clicking `warning` to resolve a test case, the test case is marked as `resolved`.

AI Firewall Continuous Tests
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can more effectively monitor your models over time on this tab. The chart and the table track changes in summary metrics over time and dive into test results at different time intervals to diagnose the underlying causes of issues.
For more information on running AI Firewall Continuous Tests, please visit `AI Firewall Continuous Tests Walkthrough <../../../walkthroughs/cli/rime_ai_firewall_continuous_tests_nlp.html>`_.

The chart graphs a summary metrics over the range of the continuous test. You can change the summary metrics charted (y value on the chart) through the top left dropdown.

.. image:: ../../../_static/nlp_ui/fw_continuous_tests_metrics_select.png

The table below shows the tests of the selected bin (one day or one hour). By clicking on the chart, you can select the range to be the current range.

.. image:: ../../../_static/nlp_ui/fw_continuous_tests_range.png

You can also use the left and right button to select the previous and the next bin.

.. image:: ../../../_static/nlp_ui/fw_continuous_tests_date_select.png

You can change the date range (x-axis range on the chart) through the top right buttons.

.. image:: ../../../_static/nlp_ui/fw_continuous_tests_date_range.png

You can see the details of a test by clicking the test table row.

.. image:: ../../../_static/nlp_ui/fw_continuous_tests_row_select.png

You will be directed to a test level view.
