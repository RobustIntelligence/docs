RIME Tabular UI
===============================
.. include:: shared.rst

AI Stress Testing
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

All test results and their summary metrics are here.

.. image:: ../../../_static/ui/Tests.png

You can click the `Download Report` button to export a summary pdf.

.. image:: ../../../_static/ui/SummaryReport.png

You can search, sort and filter the tables to evaluate test results with the view of your preference.

You can hover over the table header to reveal a description on the column.

You can view the tests by category, and the category tabs include suggestions created from the test results.

Test Detail - Test Cases
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Upon clicking a row you will get routed to a test detail page.

.. image:: ../../../_static/ui/TestDetail.png

If you click the `(i) More` button, you can read an in-depth context of the test.

.. image:: ../../../_static/ui/MoreTooltip.png

Clicking on the "Configuration" tab reveals the configurations used for the test, as well as their descriptions.

.. image:: ../../../_static/ui/MoreTooltipConfig.png

When you click to expand a test case row, you will see details of the test case result, as well as details of the feature distribution.

Tip: You can use `Esc key` for returning back to the list of tests/features page.

Test Detail - Failing Rows
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The second tab of the Test Detail page is Failing Rows.
If there were rows in your data that failed the test, this tab will surface twenty examples for you to explore.

.. image:: ../../../_static/ui/FailingRows.png

If available, you can download failing rows as a csv through the `Export Failing Rows` button.

Test Detail - Resolve
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can resolve any test case with a `warning` status by clicking the status, with an option to resolve all test cases with warnings under the test.

For example, before resolving any test case you may see something like this.

.. image:: ../../../_static/ui/Resolve.png

After clicking `warning` to resolve a test case, the test case is marked as `resolved`.

AI Firewall
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The AI Firewall provides functionality for continuous tests model metrics over time as well as blocking, flagging and imputing data points in realtime as your model is queried.

AI Firewall Overview Page
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The default tab for the AI Firewall is the following `Overview` page.

.. image:: ../../../_static/ui/FirewallOverview.png

There are five different panels in this page.

**Model Status:** This panel highlights the severity of various metrics that are tracked over time as part of AI Firewall Continuous Tests. For more information on these metrics and how the severities are calculated, see that section below.

**Key Insights:** This panel highlights Key Insights from AI Firewall Continuous Tests. For information on these Key Insights, see that section below.

**Service Metrics:** This panel features key information about the AI Firewall, how it was configured, and recent event information.

**Firewall Status:** This panel shows the number of imputed, flagged, and blocked datapoints passing through the AI Firewall over time.

**Firewall Performance:** This panel shows the performance, over time, of the model on all datapoints versus just those that were flagged by the AI Firewall.


AI Firewall Realtime Events
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The AI Firewall `Realtime Events` tab enables viewing inputs blocked, flagged or imputed by the firewall.
The custom firewall is based on the model impacts and data vulnerabilities identified during testing.
For more information on the firewall, please visit `AI Firewall How-To <../../../walkthroughs/cli/rime_firewall_realtime.html>`_.

.. image:: ../../../_static/ui/FirewallRealtimeEvents.png

By default events are shown for the latest period of time. To view the most recent period of time with events, clock on "Latest Bucket".

.. image:: ../../../_static/ui/FirewallRealtimeLatestBucket.png

You can filter the rows being shown (e.g., filter to only show flagged rows).

.. image:: ../../../_static/ui/FirewallRealtimeFilter.png

You can see the details of firewall behavior on a row by clicking on it in the table.

.. image:: ../../../_static/ui/FirewallRealtimeRowSelect.png

You will be directed to a page with more details.

.. image:: ../../../_static/ui/FirewallRealtimeRow.png


AI Firewall Continuous Tests
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The AI Firewall `Continuous Tests` tab enables tracking relevant metrics over time and diving into test results for different time intervals to diagnose the underlying causes of issues.
For more information on running AI Firewall Continuous Tests, please visit `AI Firewall Continuous Tests Walkthrough <../../../walkthroughs/cli/rime_ai_firewall_continuous_tests.html>`_.

.. image:: ../../../_static/ui/FirewallContinuousTests.png

The chart shows summary metrics over the range of time the firewall has been in use.
These summary metrics summarize tests that we run over each bin of data (e.g., each day).
You can change the summary metrics shown (y-axis on the chart) through the top left dropdown.
For a subset of these metrics (`RIME Metrics`) we provide thresholds indicating an estimated severity of the observed metric.
For each metric, there is a `Low`, `Medium` and `High` severity threshold.
These thresholds are computed based on the stress test run associated with a firewall: for example, if we observed an abnormality rate of 1% during stress testing, we'd be concerned if the abnormality rate rises significantly above 1%.

.. image:: ../../../_static/ui/FirewallContinuousTestsMetricsSelect.png

The table below shows the tests of the selected bin (one day or one hour). By clicking on the chart, you can select the range to be the current range.

.. image:: ../../../_static/ui/FirewallContinuousTestsBin.png

You can also use the left and right button to select the previous and the next bin.

.. image:: ../../../_static/ui/FirewallContinuousTestsBinSelect.png

You can change the date range (x-axis on the chart) through the top right buttons.

.. image:: ../../../_static/ui/FirewallContinuousTestsDateRange.png

You can see the details of the feature or test by clicking the test table row.

.. image:: ../../../_static/ui/FirewallContinuousTestsRowSelect.png

You will be directed to a feature or test level page. There is additional charting available in the feature level page.

.. image:: ../../../_static/ui/FirewallContinuousTestsFeatureLevel.png

To see the key insights identified by RIME, click on the icon near the top corner of the chart (note that you may be able to scroll to see more insights).

.. image:: ../../../_static/ui/FirewallContinuousTestsInsights.png

You will see the descriptions of the recurring high severity test cases. You can toggle each to highlight the bins in which they occur. You can also view the details of the latest test case by clicking on "See Test Details" on the right.
