# User Management


RIME Cloud now has a concept of users. Note: User management for enterprise 
deployments is not yet supported.

RIME has 2 kinds of users - 
#### Admin User
   * Each RIME Cloud organization can have only 1 admin user. 
   * Admins can invite other users within their organization to their RIME workspace from
   the "Members" page under "Workspace Settings". See the below image.
   * The admin will need to manually create the account details for these standard users.
   The admin can manage the user's account access.
   * The admin has the ability to create and delete API Access tokens for RIME APIs. 
   

#### Standard User
   * Standard users need to get their account details from their organization admin. 
   * Standard users have the same access as admins, except for 2 scenarios -
       * Standard users do not have access to the members page and account management. 
       * Standard users can create API tokens but not delete API tokens.
