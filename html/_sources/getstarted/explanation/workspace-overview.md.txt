# The RIME Workspace Overview

The landing page of a workspace in a RIME instance is also called the Workspace
Overview. The Workspace Overview shows a collection of summary information about 
[projects](../../for_data_scientists/how_to_guides/common_use_cases/projects.md) in the
workspace.

A ring chart at the upper left summarizes the projects in the workspace by their 
assigned tag. Project information is also available in the table at the bottom of the
page, which summarizes the following project details:

* Project name
* Description
* Status, which can be Production or Validation
* Model task

When a Continuous Test is configured, the following additional summary information is available:
* Activity: A chart that displays a time series of a configured metric.
* Overall model health
* Operational health
* Security health
* Bias and fairness health
* Data types
* Last data upload
* Project owner
* Active alerts

Model health metrics are discussed in more depth in [Continuous Testing feedback and observability](../../for_data_scientists/how_to_guides/common_use_cases/ct-events-rca.md).

To the right of the ring chart, a comparison chart enables you to compare several
aspects across projects.

## Configuring the project comparison chart

1.  Sign in to a RIME instance.  
    >    The Workspaces page appears.
2.  Click a workspace.  
    >    The Workspace Overview appears.
3.  From the *Metric* drop-down, choose a metric to compare.
4.  From the *Projects* drop-down, select a set of projects to compare.
    >   You can select up to 5 metrics to compare across projects. When projects have different bin sizes, the larger bin size is used.
5.  From the *Aggregation* drop-down, select an aggregation type.
    >   *   *None* performs no aggregation. No more than 7 projects can be compared without aggregation.
    >   *   *Sum, selected projects* aggregates projects by the sum of the chosen metric.
    >   *   *Average, selected projects* aggregates projects by the average of the chosen metric.
    >   Only projects with equal bin sizes can be shown in an aggregated view. Empty bins are skipped for the project with the empty bin.
6.  Select a time interval.

The project comparison chart updates according to the selections.
