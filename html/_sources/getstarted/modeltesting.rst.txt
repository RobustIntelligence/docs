Our entire stress testing suite helps fulfill the requirements SR 11-7 specifies under Section IV. Model Development, Implementation and Use: "An integral part of model development is testing, in which the various components of a model and its overall functioning are evaluated to determine whether the model is performing as intended. Model testing includes checking the model's accuracy, demonstrating that the model is robust and stable, assessing potential limitations, and evaluating the model's behavior over a range of input values. It should also assess the impact of assumptions and identify situations where the model performs poorly or becomes unreliable." In addition our entire test suite helps fulfill the requirements specified under Section V. Model Validation: "Documentation and testing should convey an understanding of model limitations and assumptions," which is a key outcome of the entire test suite. Our Continuous Testing capabilities allow for ongoing monitoring, which is another key part of SR 11-7's Section V. Model Validation: "The second core element of the validation process is ongoing monitoring. Such monitoring confirms that the model is appropriately implemented and is being used and is performing as intended. |

Further, SR 11-7 requires the evaluation of a model's conceptual soundness in Section V. Model Validation: our Abnormal Input and Distribution Drift test categoires both "verify that models are performing as expected" and "also identifies potential limitations and assumptions, and assesses their possible impact."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

Our full stress testing suite fulfills this all-encompassing risk management system requirement. In addition, Chapter 2 of the Act requires human oversight throughout the AI lifecycle to "facilitate the respect of other fundamental rights by minimising the risk of erroneous or biased AI-assisted decisions in critical areas such as education and training, employment, important services, law enforcement and the judiciary," which the RI platform allows for by having a user-friendly UI and notifications and alerts for any updates on model testing. Model cards also allow for logging and documentation of model testing results, which can be used for reporting and tracking.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

Our entire stress testing suite helps fulfill the requirements SR 11-7 specifies under Section IV. Model Development, Implementation and Use: "An integral part of model development is testing, in which the various components of a model and its overall functioning are evaluated to determine whether the model is performing as intended. Model testing includes checking the model's accuracy, demonstrating that the model is robust and stable, assessing potential limitations, and evaluating the model's behavior over a range of input values. It should also assess the impact of assumptions and identify situations where the model performs poorly or becomes unreliable." In addition our entire test suite helps fulfill the requirements specified under Section V. Model Validation: "Documentation and testing should convey an understanding of model limitations and assumptions," which is a key outcome of the entire test suite. Our Continuous Testing capabilities allow for ongoing monitoring, which is another key part of SR 11-7's Section V. Model Validation section: "The second core element of the validation process is ongoing monitoring. Such monitoring confirms that the model is appropriately implemented and is being used and is performing as intended.                                                                   |

Further, SR 11-7 requires the evaluation of a model's conceptual soundness in Section V. Model Validation: our Attacks and Transformation test categories employ sensitivity analysis tests which can "check the impact of small changes in inputs and parameter values on model outputs to make sure they fall within an expected range."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

Our full stress testing suite fulfills this all-encompassing risk management system requirement. In addition, Chapter 2 of the Act requires human oversight throughout the AI lifecycle to "facilitate the respect of other fundamental rights by minimising the risk of erroneous or biased AI-assisted decisions in critical areas such as education and training, employment, important services, law enforcement and the judiciary," which the RI platform allows for by having a user-friendly UI and notifications and alerts for any updates on model testing. Model cards also allow for logging and documentation of model testing results, which can be used for reporting and tracking.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

Our entire stress testing suite helps fulfill the requirements SR 11-7 specifies under Section IV. Model Development, Implementation and Use: "An integral part of model development is testing, in which the various components of a model and its overall functioning are evaluated to determine whether the model is performing as intended. Model testing includes checking the model's accuracy, demonstrating that the model is robust and stable, assessing potential limitations, and evaluating the model's behavior over a range of input values. It should also assess the impact of assumptions and identify situations where the model performs poorly or becomes unreliable." In addition our entire test suite helps fulfill the requirements specified under Section V. Model Validation: "Documentation and testing should convey an understanding of model limitations and assumptions," which is a key outcome of the entire test suite. Our Continuous Testing capabilities allow for ongoing monitoring, which is another key part of SR 11-7's Section V. Model Validation section: "The second core element of the validation process is ongoing monitoring. Such monitoring confirms that the model is appropriately implemented and is being used and is performing as intended.                                                                   |

Further, SR 11-7 requires the evaluation of a model's conceptual soundness in Section V. Model Validation: the guidelines require both that "validation should be done by people who are not responsible for development or use and do not have a stake in whether a model is determined to be valid" and prevents bias, which our Compliance test cateogry fulfills.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

Our full stress testing suite fulfills this all-encompassing risk management system requirement. In addition, Chapter 2 of the Act requires human oversight throughout the AI lifecycle to "facilitate the respect of other fundamental rights by minimising the risk of erroneous or biased AI-assisted decisions in critical areas such as education and training, employment, important services, law enforcement and the judiciary," which the RI platform allows for by having a user-friendly UI and notifications and alerts for any updates on model testing. Model cards also allow for logging and documentation of model testing results, which can be used for reporting and tracking.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

Our entire stress testing suite helps fulfill the requirements SR 11-7 specifies under Section IV. Model Development, Implementation and Use: "An integral part of model development is testing, in which the various components of a model and its overall functioning are evaluated to determine whether the model is performing as intended. Model testing includes checking the model's accuracy, demonstrating that the model is robust and stable, assessing potential limitations, and evaluating the model's behavior over a range of input values. It should also assess the impact of assumptions and identify situations where the model performs poorly or becomes unreliable." In addition our entire test suite helps fulfill the requirements specified under Section V. Model Validation: "Documentation and testing should convey an understanding of model limitations and assumptions," which is a key outcome of the entire test suite. Our Continuous Testing capabilities allow for ongoing monitoring, which is another key part of SR 11-7's Section V. Model Validation section: "The second core element of the validation process is ongoing monitoring. Such monitoring confirms that the model is appropriately implemented and is being used and is performing as intended.                                                                   |

Our entire stress testing suite helps fulfill the requirements SR 11-7 specifies under Section IV. Model Development, Implementation and Use: "An integral part of model development is testing, in which the various components of a model and its overall functioning are evaluated to determine whether the model is performing as intended. Model testing includes checking the model's accuracy, demonstrating that the model is robust and stable, assessing potential limitations, and evaluating the model's behavior over a range of input values. It should also assess the impact of assumptions and identify situations where the model performs poorly or becomes unreliable." In addition our entire test suite helps fulfill the requirements specified under Section V. Model Validation: "Documentation and testing should convey an understanding of model limitations and assumptions," which is a key outcome of the entire test suite. Our Continuous Testing capabilities allow for ongoing monitoring, which is another key part of SR 11-7's Section V. Model Validation section: "The second core element of the validation process is ongoing monitoring. Such monitoring confirms that the model is appropriately implemented and is being used and is performing as intended.                                                                   |

Our full stress testing suite fulfills this all-encompassing risk management system requirement. In addition, Chapter 2 of the Act requires human oversight throughout the AI lifecycle to "facilitate the respect of other fundamental rights by minimising the risk of erroneous or biased AI-assisted decisions in critical areas such as education and training, employment, important services, law enforcement and the judiciary," which the RI platform allows for by having a user-friendly UI and notifications and alerts for any updates on model testing. Model cards also allow for logging and documentation of model testing results, which can be used for reporting and tracking.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

Our entire stress testing suite helps fulfill the requirements SR 11-7 specifies under Section IV. Model Development, Implementation and Use: "An integral part of model development is testing, in which the various components of a model and its overall functioning are evaluated to determine whether the model is performing as intended. Model testing includes checking the model's accuracy, demonstrating that the model is robust and stable, assessing potential limitations, and evaluating the model's behavior over a range of input values. It should also assess the impact of assumptions and identify situations where the model performs poorly or becomes unreliable." In addition our entire test suite helps fulfill the requirements specified under Section V. Model Validation: "Documentation and testing should convey an understanding of model limitations and assumptions," which is a key outcome of the entire test suite. Our Continuous Testing capabilities allow for ongoing monitoring, which is another key part of SR 11-7's Section V. Model Validation section: "The second core element of the validation process is ongoing monitoring.

Our full stress testing suite fulfills this all-encompassing risk management system requirement. In addition, Chapter 2 of the Act requires human oversight throughout the AI lifecycle to "facilitate the respect of other fundamental rights by minimising the risk of erroneous or biased AI-assisted decisions in critical areas such as education and training, employment, important services, law enforcement and the judiciary," which the RI platform allows for by having a user-friendly UI and notifications and alerts for any updates on model testing. Model cards also allow for logging and documentation of model testing results, which can be used for reporting and tracking.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

Our entire stress testing suite helps fulfill the requirements SR 11-7 specifies under Section IV. Model Development, Implementation and Use: "An integral part of model development is testing, in which the various components of a model and its overall functioning are evaluated to determine whether the model is performing as intended. Model testing includes checking the model's accuracy, demonstrating that the model is robust and stable, assessing potential limitations, and evaluating the model's behavior over a range of input values.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

In addition our entire test suite helps fulfill the requirements specified under Section V. Model Validation: "Documentation and testing should convey an understanding of model limitations and assumptions," which is a key outcome of the entire test suite. Our Continuous Testing capabilities allow for ongoing monitoring, which is another key part of SR 11-7's Section V. Model Validation section: "The second core element of the validation process is ongoing monitoring. Such monitoring confirms that the model is appropriately implemented and is being used and is performing as intended. Ongoing monitoring is essential to evaluate whether changes in products, exposures, activities, clients, or market conditions necessitate adjustment, redevelopment, or replacement of the model and to verify that any extension of the model beyond its original scope is valid." Further, SR 11-7 requires the evaluation of a model's conceptual soundness in Section V. Model Validation: our Attacks and Transformation test categories employ sensitivity analysis tests which can "check the impact of small changes in inputs and parameter values on model outputs to make sure they fall within an expected range."                                                                                                                                  |

Our full stress testing suite fulfills this all-encompassing risk management system requirement. In addition, Chapter 2 of the Act requires human oversight throughout the AI lifecycle to "facilitate the respect of other fundamental rights by minimising the risk of erroneous or biased AI-assisted decisions in critical areas such as education and training, employment, important services, law enforcement and the judiciary," which the RI platform allows for by having a user-friendly UI and notifications and alerts for any updates on model testing.

All of the RIME tests are listed in the following sections, along with detailed descriptions.

Tests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Tabular tests are performed on table-formatted data. Generally speaking, data that
consists of a list of records with various attributes for a given data can be considered
tabular.

NLP models attempt to correctly parse human speech, recognize entities being referred to
by that speech, and analyze implied qualities of that speech, such as emotional subtext.

CV models attempt to interpret images to discern specific objects within the image or
generally classify the contents of an image.

RIME local trial
----------------

The **Local Trial** provides a way for users to test core RI features directly on their 
machine using Docker containers and the ``rime-engine`` CLI.

Note that many Kubernetes-dependent features of RIME, including the Python SDK, are
unavailable in the local environment.
