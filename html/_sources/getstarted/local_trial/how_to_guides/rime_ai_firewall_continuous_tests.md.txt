# Monitoring Your Model with Continuous Tests

Continuous Tests in the RIME Local Trial are handled the same way as [Continuous Tests](../../../for_data_scientists/how_to_guides/common_use_cases/ct-ui.md) generally are.

## Using Your Own Model and Datasets

This guide will cover how to run Continuous Tests on your own model and datasets.

### Collect Data in the Correct Format

Data formatting requirements are very similar to those for AI Stress Tests (see [Input Data Format](/for_data_scientists/reference/tabular/task_data_format.md)); however, **for continuous tests, timestamp information is also needed.**

For AI Firewall Continuous Tests, RI requires two datasets: a reference dataset and an (incremental) evaluation dataset. The latter must supply a datetime column so that it can be sliced into batches appropriately. Bin-sized slices of the evaluation dataset will be compared to the reference dataset during continuous testing.

Datasets must be passed in as a `.csv` or `.parquet` file, where each column is a separate feature, and predictions must be present in both datasets.

### Create Configuration

With your data ready, you can now create a configuration file.

For a detailed reference on what the configuration should look like, see [Continuous Tests Configuration](/for_data_scientists/reference/tabular/firewall_continuous_tests.md).
