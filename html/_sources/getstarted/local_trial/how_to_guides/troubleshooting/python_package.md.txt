# Debugging the Python Package

## I'm seeing `ModuleNotFound` errors in the console. How do I resolve them?

    These errors likely result from not having the extras installed for your use case.

    Make sure you are inside of the `rime_trial/` directory using your `rime-venv` virtual environment before proceeding.

    (If not already run during installation) Run the following to generate the necessary requirements lists:
    ```bash
    python rime_helper.py generate-rime-requirements --token-file $PATH_TO_TOKEN_TXT_FILE
    ```

    For Natural Language Processing (NLP) use cases (i.e., text data):
    ```bash
    pip install -r nlp_requirements.txt
    ```

    For Computer Vision (CV) use cases (i.e., image data):
    ```bash
    pip install -r cv_requirements.txt
    ```

## I'm seeing `grpc.FutureTimeoutError`(s) when trying to upload stress tests. How do I resolve them?

    This error can be due to DNS resolution across operating systems and protocols (IPv4 vs. IPv6).

    If that is the case, running the following in your terminal session can resolve the issue:
    ```bash
    export GRPC_DNS_RESOLVER=native
    ```

    Otherwise, make sure your machine has access to the endpoint(s) in question (e.g., by enabling VPN).
