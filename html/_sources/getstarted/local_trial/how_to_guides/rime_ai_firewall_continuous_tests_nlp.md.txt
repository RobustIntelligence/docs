# Monitoring Your Model with AI Firewall Continuous Tests

This guide will cover how to configure the AI Firewall to continuously monitor your model in production.

We will be using a text classification model trained on a slightly modified version of the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.kaggle.com/Cornell-University/arxiv">arXiv</a> dataset, which is available in the `rime_trial/` bundle provided during installation.

## Running AI Firewall Continuous Tests

### 1. Run AI Stress Testing

Kick off a Stress Testing run (the reference dataset and model from this run will be used for firewall continuous tests).
```bash
rime-engine run-nlp --config-path nlp_examples/classification/arxiv/stress_tests_config_no_model.json
```

### 2. Configure a Firewall in the Web Client

### 3. Run Continuous Tests on Incremental Data

We can now upload data and predictions and run AI Firewall Continuous Tests. The following command uses data from June 18, 2007 to June 25, 2007.

NOTE: If you forgot to record the firewall ID in the previous step, you can find it by clicking the <img src="../../../_static/ui/GearIcon.svg" /> on the right.
```bash
rime-engine run-firewall-nlp --config-path nlp_examples/classification/arxiv/firewall_config.json --firewall-id $FIREWALL_ID
```

To simulate an incremental data load from the next week, simply update the configuration file (`nlp_examples/classification/arxiv/firewall_config.json`) to point to the next dataset:
```python
{
 "eval_path": "nlp_examples/classification/arxiv/data/val_2.json.gz",
 "eval_pred_path": "nlp_examples/classification/arxiv/data/preds.val_2.jsonl.gz"
}
```

You can then re-run the `run-firewall-nlp` command to upload the next batch of data.

To upload data for the remaining 7 weeks in our examples, simply repeat this process for data files `val_3.json.gz`/`preds.val_3.jsonl.gz` through `val_9.json.gz`/`preds.val_9.jsonl.gz`

## Using Your Own Model and Datasets

This guide will cover how to run AI Firewall Continuous Tests on your own model and datasets.

### Collect Data in the Correct Format

Data formatting requirements are very similar to those for AI Stress Tests (see [Input Data Format](/for_data_scientists/reference/task_data_format.md)); however, **for continuous tests, timestamp information is also needed.**

For AI Firewall Continuous Tests, RI requires two datasets: a reference dataset and an (incremental) evaluation dataset. The latter must supply timestamps with each data point, using the key `"timestamp"`. This allows the data to be sliced into batches appropriately, each of which will be compared to the reference dataset during continuous testing.

Datasets must be passed in as `.json` or `.jsonl` files, optionally compressed via `gzip` (creating `json.gz` or `jsonl.gz`).

### Create Configuration

With your data ready, you can now create a configuration file.

For a detailed reference on what the configuration should look like, see [Continuous Tests Configuration](/for_data_scientists/reference/firewall_continuous_tests.md).

### Run the CLI

#### AI Firewall Continuous Tests

You will need to have configured a firewall in the web client beforehand to get a Firewall ID. Please refer to the sections above for instructions.

Once complete, you can run the CLI like so:
```bash
rime-engine run-firewall-nlp --firewall-id $FIREWALL_ID --config-path <PATH-TO-CONFIGURATION>
```
