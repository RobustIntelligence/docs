# Installation
The Local Trial installation consists of two parts:
1. The Docker containers
    - These create the infrastructure necessary to process and display test results.
2. The Python package
    - This contains the `rime-engine` command-line interface (CLI) and Python libraries used to run tests on your models and data.

## Prerequisites
Verify that the system meets the following requirements before beginning:
- The following resources:
    - at least 4 GB RAM
    - at least 12 GB free disk space
    - 3.7 ≤ `python` ≤ 3.9
    - one of the following package managers
        - `pip`
        - `conda`
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) >= 20.10.0
    - **Linux Users:** You will also need to follow these [post installation instructions](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/) to use Docker without root access.
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) >= 1.29.0
- The `rime_trial` bundle ( {{ '[download here](https://storage.googleapis.com/rime-trial-zips/rime-trial-{}.tar.gz)'.format(env.config.version) }} )
- A `token.txt` file (will be provided by your RI representative)

**NOTE for M1 Mac Users**: We recommend using the [Rosetta Translation Environment](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/apple-silicon/about-the-rosetta-translation-environment) to run the RI Local Trial, as many dependent packages do not have native M1 support yet.
- Additionally, you will need to downgrade the MongoDB dependency in `docker-compose.yml` due to M1 incompatibility:
  ```
  # for M1 compatibility
  image: bitnami/mongodb:5.0.9
  ```

## Install the Docker Containers
### Set Up Your Environment
To avoid interfering with your other projects' dependencies, we will create a new Python virtual environment for the Local Trial.

1. Download ( {{'[link here](https://storage.googleapis.com/rime-trial-zips/rime-trial-{}.tar.gz)'.format(env.config.version)}} )
   and extract ({{ '`tar -xzf rime-trial-{}.tar.gz`'.format(env.config.version) }}) the `rime_trial` bundle.
2. Place the `token.txt` file inside of `rime_trial/`.
3. Step into `rime_trial/` --- this will be our working directory throughout the installation.
4. Select a virtual environment manager (currently either `pip` or Conda) and follow the appropriate instructions below.
    <p id="alert-turquoise">
    <b>Pip Installation</b>
    </p>

    1. Create a new [python virtual
    environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html).
        ```
        python -m venv rime-venv
        ```
    2. Activate the virtual environment.
       <p id="turquoise-header">
       <b>macOS & Linux</b>
       </p>

       ```bash
       source rime-venv/bin/activate
       ```

       <p id="blue-header">
       <b>Windows</b>
       </p>

       ```powershell
       .\rime-venv\Scripts\activate
       ```
    3. Update pip and install required Python packages from
        `trial_requirements.txt`.
        ```
        pip install --upgrade pip
        pip install -r trial_requirements.txt
        ```

    <p id="alert-blue">
    <b>Conda Installation</b>
    </p>

    1. Create a new [conda virtual
    environment](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html).
    Replace `$PYTHON_VERSION_YOU_WISH_TO_USE` with the version of Python that you
    wish to use (e.g., `3.8`).
        ```
        conda create --name rime-venv python=$PYTHON_VERSION_YOU_WISH_TO_USE
        ```
    2. Activate the virtual environment.
        ```
        conda activate rime-venv
        ```
    5. Update pip and install required Python packages from
        `trial_requirements.txt`.
        ```
        pip install --upgrade pip
        pip install -r trial_requirements.txt
        ```


### Start RI
<p id="alert-yellow">
<b>NOTE:</b> Running the start command will generate a Robust Intelligence
license file and place it in a newly created .robustintelligence folder in your
$HOME directory.
</p>

1. Run the rime_helper `start` command to start the backend and frontend.
    ```bash
    python rime_helper.py start
    ```
2. Wait until you see the following message indicating that the backend and
frontend have successfully started and that the UI can be viewed at
[http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).
    ```bash
    RI is available at http://localhost:8080
    ```
3. (OPTIONAL) If you are running the Docker containers on a remote instance and would like to use
**port forwarding** to view the UI on your local machine, we recommend using SSH tunneling:
    ```bash
    ssh -NT -L localhost:8080:localhost:8080 user@hostname
    ```

#### Log in to the Web Client
Local Trial deployments of the RI Platform are preconfigured with a user account that has administrator [privileges](../../../../for_admins/users.md).
Your Robust Intelligence representative will provide you with the relevant credentials.

Open a web browser to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) and log in using the one-time credentials.

### Stop RI
<p id="warning-box">
<b>WARNING:</b> The commands below will permanently delete existing RI test runs.
</p>

To stop RI, run the following. Note that this command will also delete existing test runs.
```bash
python rime_helper.py stop
```

**To completely remove RI, you can uninstall.**
```bash
python rime_helper.py uninstall
```

## Install the Python Package
1. Install the `rime` Python package.
    ```bash
    pip install -r rime_requirements.txt
    ```
2. Configure environment variables for use in CLI commands:
    <p id="turquoise-header">
    <b>macOS & Linux</b>
    </p>

    ```bash
    export RIME_UPLOAD_URL=localhost:5001
    export RIME_FIREWALL_URL=localhost:5002
    export RIME_DISABLE_TLS=True # Recommended for local uploads only!
    ```

    <p id="blue-header">
    <b>Windows</b>
    </p>

    ```
    $Env:RIME_UPLOAD_URL = 'localhost:5001'
    $Env:RIME_FIREWALL_URL = 'localhost:5002'
    $Env:RIME_DISABLE_TLS = 'True' # Recommended for local uploads only!
    ```

### Install the NLP Dependencies (Optional)

To use RI with Natural Language Processing models, additional Python dependencies must be installed.

```bash
pip install -r nlp_requirements.txt
```

### Install the CV Dependencies (Optional)

To use RI with Computer Vision models, additional Python dependencies must be installed.

```bash
pip install -r cv_requirements.txt
```

# Running Your First AI Stress Test

Let's begin by stress testing a binary classification model using the `rime-engine` CLI! This example uses a modified version of the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/adult-census-income" target="_blank">Adult Census Income Dataset</a> from Kaggle that we've included in the `rime_trial/` bundle provided during installation.

## Executing Stress Tests From the Command Line

Be sure to run this example from the `rime_trial/` directory so that local paths to datasets resolve correctly!

```bash
rime-engine run-stress-tests --config-path examples/income/stress_tests_model.json
```

## Analyzing Results in the Web Client

This command runs a batch of stress tests that are designed to detect vulnerabilities in a ML pipeline. Begin by clicking into the "Default Workspace".

![](/_static/ui/WorkspacesDefaultWorkspace.png)

The results appear in the Default project, which is available on all new RI Platform deployments.

![](/_static/ui/ProjectsDefaultProject.png)

Once the command completes, you should be able to see the test run in the Default project (see table below for URL).

![](/_static/ui/TestRunsIncomeExample.png)

From there, you can open the test run "Income (With Model)" and start exploring the results!
