# The RIME Workspace Overview

The landing page of a workspace in a RIME instance is also called the Workspace
Overview. The Workspace Overview shows a collection of summary information about 
[projects](../../for_data_scientists/how_to_guides/common_use_cases/projects.md) in the
workspace.

A ring chart at the upper left summarizes the projects in the workspace by their 
assigned tag. Project information is also available in the table at the bottom of the
page, which summarizes the following project details:

* Project name
* Description
* Status, which can be Production, Validation, or <!-- what are the possible states -->
* Activity: A chart that displays a time series of a configured metric. The following
metrics are available:
    * Model performance
    * Accuracy
    * Prediction drift
    * Precision
    * Concept drift
    * Abnormality rate
* Overall model health
* Operational health
* Security health
* Bias and fairness health
* Model task
* Data types
* Last data upload
* Project owner
* Active alerts

To the right of the ring chart, a comparison chart enables you to compare several
aspects across projects.

## Configuring the project comparison chart

1.  Sign in to a RIME instance.  
    >    The Workspaces page appears.
2.  Click a workspace.  
    >    The Workspace Overview appears.
3.  From the *Metric* drop-down, choose a metric to compare.
    >   *   Model performance
    >   *   Accuracy
    >   *   Prediction drift
    >   *   Precision
    >   *   Concept drift
    >   *   Abnormality rate
4.  From the *Projects* drop-down, select a set of projects to compare.
5.  From the *Aggregation* drop-down, select an aggregation type.
    >   *   *None* performs no aggregation. No more than 7 projects can be compared without aggregation.
    >   *   *Sum, selected projects* aggregates projects by the sum of the chosen metric.
    >   *   *Average, selected projects* aggregates projects by the average of the chosen metric.
6.  Select a time interval.

The project comparison chart updates according to the selections.
