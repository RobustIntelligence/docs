Get Started
================================

RIME can be installed in different ways, depending on your needs.

For most use cases, we suggest using **RIME Cloud**, our most lightweight installation.
Users need only install our Python SDK to get started with the cloud product, and we will manage the cluster for you.

Alternatively, we support on-premise integrations with **RIME Enterprise**, an installation that we will conduct with your DevOps team to set up a RIME Kubernetes cluster in your VPC.
