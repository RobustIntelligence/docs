# Managing users

Administrators of an RI Platform instance can create and manage individual user accounts.
Administrators of an RI Platform instance or of a [workspace](workspaces.md) within an RI Platform instance
can add or remove users from that workspace.

Account privileges are mediated using [role-based access control](rbac.md) (RBAC).

## Adding instance-level users

    Platform instance.  
    >    The Workspaces page appears.
2.  Click the *Settings* icon in the lower left.  
    >    The Organization Settings page appears.
3.  Click *Members*.
    >   The Members pane appears.
4.  Click *Add New Member*.
    >   The Add New Member dialog box appears.
5.  In *Name*, type a username for the new user.

    >   Org. Admin
    >   : Instance administrator.
    >   Org. Member
    >   : Standard instance user.
    >   Support
    >   : Support account.
7.  In *Email Address*, type an email address for the new user.
8.  In *Password*, type a password for the new user.
9.  In *Confirm Password*, type the password again.
10. Click *Add New Member*.

The new user account is ready.
