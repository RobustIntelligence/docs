# User account roles

User accounts can have one of several roles and associated privileges.

An **Organization-level administrator** has administrative privileges over the entire instance,
and can perform the following actions:

* Create workspaces
* Edit workspaces 
* Delete workspaces 
* View and use workspaces 
* Timezone settings 
* Audit log settings 
* SSO configuration 
* User management 
* Data source configuration 
* SMTP configuration 

A **Basic user** is a user account with membership in no workspaces. Such users can log in, but
have no privileges on the RI Platform instance.

A **Workspace administrator** is a user account with administrative privileges over a workspace,
and can perform the following actions:

* Grant or revoke membership in that workspace
* Configure and set up the workspace
* Manage API access tokens
* View the status of agents assigned to the workspace
* Has access to managed images

A **Workspace member** is a user account with membership in a workspace. Such users can view
and use their assigned workspace.

A **Support user** is a special-purpose account used to provide user support and guidance.
Support users have the same privileges as Organization-level administrators, but those privileges
can be revoked by Organization-level administrators when the Support user is no longer required.

A **Workspace VP user** is a user account with the same privileges as a workspace administrator.

A **Workspace viewer** is a user account that can view all public projects in a workspace as
well as any projects in the workspace that have been explicitly shared with that user account.
A user account with the Workspace viewer role can take no action other than viewing the
contents of the workspace.
