# Workspaces

A workspace is an environment for organizing and accessing all of your Robust
Intelligence assets. All the Robust Intelligence assets in a workspace are 
unique to that workspace.

A workspace must be assigned at least one [agent](agentmgmt.md). A given agent can be assigned to
multiple workspaces. A workspace must have a default agent specified. Jobs are run
with the default agent when an agent is not specified for that job.

## Governance dashboard

The Governance dashboard provides a single pane of glass for all models in production in a workspace.
Health status and variance across time of custom metrics are available for models in production.
The Governance dashboard lists all models in use in a given workspace, with links to access those
models directly.
