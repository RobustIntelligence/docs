Installation Guide
================================

The RI Platform is deployed as a Kubernetes cluster with two conceptual entities: a **control plane** and a **data plane**.

The **control plane** consists of core application services like the web server and user management.

The **data plane** executes the machine learning testing suite on your models and data, generating test results for the control plane to serve to users.

These two entities can be deployed in multiple configurations, depending on your organization's needs.
