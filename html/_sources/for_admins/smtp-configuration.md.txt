# Configuring SMTP for alerts

Sending alerts over email requires access to an SMTP server.

1.  Sign in to an RI Platform instance.  
    >   The Workspaces page appears.
2.  Click *Settings* in the lower left corner.  
    >   The Organization Settings page appears.
3.  Click *SMTP Configuration*.  
    >   The SMTP Configuration pane appears.
4.  Type the email address for the SMTP server in *Email*.  
5.  Type the password for the SMTP server in *Email Password*.  
6.  Type the URL for the SMTP server in *Server Url*.  
7.  Type a port number in *Port*.  
    >   The choice of port number defines the expected encryption approach.  
    | Port | Behavior                                |
    |------|-----------------------------------------|
    | 25   | No encryption                           |
    | 465  | Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)              |
    | 587  | Opportunistic TLS (STARTTLS)            |
    | 2525 | Transport Layer Security (TLS)          |
8.  From the *Timezone* drop-down, select a time zone.  
    >   Email sent from this SMTP server bases timestamps on the selected time zone.
9.  Click *Save*.  

The RI Platform instance can now [send email alerts](../../for_data_scientists/how_to_guides/alerting/setup_alerts.md) using the configured SMTP server.
