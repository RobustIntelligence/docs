# Update

Currently, updating RIME is a manual process (we will add more automated updates very soon!). Here's how you can update the various pieces of RIME.

## SDK update
Updating the SDK is very easy, simply run:
```
pip install rime-sdk --upgrade
```

## Cluster image update
- Update `version` in terraform.
- Run `terraform apply` to apply changes to your cluster. You will also need to `helm update` if you are not using terraform managed helm release.
- After a few minutes your RIME images should all be updated.

## Cluster update
- Update your terraform module version (change the source of the module to the appropriate version).
- Run `helm repo update`.
- Run a `terraform get -update` and `terraform apply`.
- Once the apply finishes, your cluster should be updated!
