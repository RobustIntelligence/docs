FAQ
================================

1 - Can the data plane be deployed on a *single machine* (e.g., for testing purposes)?
   Yes --- if deploying the data plane on a single machine, refer to the **Local Agent** deployment guide below:

2 - Can Robust Intelligence be deployed entirely (i.e., *both planes*) in my cloud environment?
   Yes --- if deploying *both* planes in your cloud environment, refer to the **Self-Hosted** deployment guide below.
   Note that Self-Hosted deployments follow a longer release cadence than standard deployments (see note on upgrades below).

3 - How are product upgrades executed?
   Minor versions are released every six weeks, with routine patches implemented as necessary between releases.
   Self-Hosted deployments are released every 12 weeks.

   The upgrade process involves incrementing the versions of the Docker image(s), Helm chart(s), and Python SDK associated with your Robust Intelligence deployment.
   Robust Intelligence will reach out beforehand to coordinate each upgrade.

   API endpoints will be gracefully deprecated and released according to the API Versioning strategy (see below).

4 - Which cloud providers does Robust Intelligence support?
   Though we design our product to be cloud-agnostic, our official testing currently covers `AWS`_ (`EKS`_), `GCP`_ (`GKE`_), and `Azure`_ (`AKS`_).
