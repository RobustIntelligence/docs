Overview
================================

Robust Intelligence runs on Kubernetes.

To isolate data source access and reduce maintenance burden, core services are split into two separate planes: a **control plane** and a **data plane**.

The **control plane** handles all client interactions, hosting application services like the web server and user management.

The control plane is managed for you on dedicated infrastructure in the Robust Intelligence cloud.

The **data plane** hosts the model testing agent, which fulfills requests submitted by the control plane.
This agent queries your models and data sources to execute the Robust Intelligence testing suite.
Test results are sent to the control plane, where users can view them.

The data plane is deployed within your cloud Kubernetes environment; however, a fully-managed option is available as well.

Your RI Solutions Architect will guide you through deploying the data plane and integrating Robust Intelligence with your MLOps pipelines.
