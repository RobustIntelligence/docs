In this configuration, **both planes** are hosted in your organizationâ€™s private cloud.

Your Solutions Architect (SA) will lead the deployment with your MLOps team.

Phase 1: Scoping
   *Estimated Duration:  1 session with an RI Solutions Architect and your DevOps Administrator(s)*

   Your SA will guide you through the system requirements so that you can prepare resources with your internal teams in advance.

   A recommendation to either deploy directly through `Helm`_ or with the automated `Terraform`_ modules will be given based on your environment.

   By the end of this phase, you should be ready to begin executing the deployment.

Phase 2: Deployment
   *Estimated Duration: 3 sessions with an RI Solutions Architect and your DevOps Engineer(s)*

   At this point, you can begin executing the relevant deployment commands, iterating on configurations as necessary.

Phase 3: Validation
   *Estimated Duration: 1 Session with an RI Solutions Architect and your DevOps Engineer(s)*

   Your SA will guide you through smoke-testing the new Robust Intelligence deployment through a series of validation steps.
