Self-Hosted Architecture
-------------------------------

In this configuration, **both planes** are hosted in your organizationâ€™s private cloud.

The Self-Hosted configuration provides complete control over the Robust Intelligence cluster's behavior, including network routing, storage management, and compute resource optimization for model testing jobs.

Note that services may behave differently if alternative configurations are used.

Deployment Process
-------------------------------

Your Solutions Architect (SA) will lead the deployment with your MLOps team.

Phase 1: Scoping
   *Estimated Duration:  1 session with an RI Solutions Architect and your DevOps Administrator(s)*

   Your SA will guide you through the system requirements so that you can prepare resources with your internal teams in advance.

   A recommendation to either deploy directly through `Helm`_ or with the automated `Terraform`_ modules will be given based on your environment.

   By the end of this phase, you should be ready to begin executing the deployment.

Phase 2: Deployment
   *Estimated Duration: 3 sessions with an RI Solutions Architect and your DevOps Engineer(s)*

   At this point, you can begin executing the relevant deployment commands, iterating on configurations as necessary.

Phase 3: Validation
   *Estimated Duration: 1 Session with an RI Solutions Architect and your DevOps Engineer(s)*

   Your SA will guide you through smoke-testing the new Robust Intelligence deployment through a series of validation steps.
