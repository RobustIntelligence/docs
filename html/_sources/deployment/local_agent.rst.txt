Local Agent
================================

The **Local Agent** deployment pattern allows you to deploy Robust Intelligence onto a single machine, using a local Kubernetes service such as `kind`_ or `minikube`_.

Using this architecture, the Robust Intelligence data plane can run on your own laptop, using data and models from your local filesystem instead of cloud storage.

.. _kind: https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/

.. _minikube: https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/

The Local Agent deployment leverages the same self-guided installation process as the cloud-based deployment patterns, with slight modifications. To begin, start with **Deployment** below.
