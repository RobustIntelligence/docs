Local Agent
================================

The RI Platform Agent can be installed on a local Kubernetes cluster using Kind or Minikube.

Reasons to Use a Local Agent
----------------------------

- The local agent runs on your machine. You do not need access to a Kubernetes cluster running on your organization's cloud.
- Running locally also gives you full access and observability into the running tests for easy debugging and insight into resource usage.
- The local agent can use data and model files from your local file system. You do not need to upload the data to cloud storage or grant the agent permissions to read from cloud storage.
