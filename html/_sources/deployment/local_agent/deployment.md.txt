# Deployment

## Requirements
- Designated directory on your local filesystem for model and data files
    - (e.g.,  `/Users/name/Documents/my-data-directory`)
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) (with configurations below)
    - Docker must have access to 8GB+ of memory (set via Docker Desktop in Preferences > Resources > Advanced > Memory)
    - Docker must have File Sharing configured with your designated directory (specify the *absolute path* of this directory in Docker Desktop in Preferences > Resources > File Sharing)
- **A local K8s cluster** (recommended setup instructions below)
    - [kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/)
    - [minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/)
- [Helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/)
- [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/)

### Local K8s Cluster Setup (kind)
1. Install [kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/#installation).
2. Create a kind configuration file that mounts the directory containing your data and models to an alias called `/ri-platform/local/` on the virtual nodes.
```yaml
kind: Cluster
apiVersion: kind.x-k8s.io/v1alpha4
nodes:
- role: control-plane
  extraMounts:
    - hostPath: <ABSOLUTE PATH ON LOCAL FILESYSTEM>
      containerPath: /ri-platform/local
```
3. With Docker running, create the cluster:
    1. `kind create cluster --config <above config file>`
4. Ensure your `kubectl` context is set to the cluster you created:
    1. `kubectl config use-context kind`

### Local K8s Cluster Setup (minikube)
1. Install [Minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/)
2. With Docker running, create the cluster:
    - `minikube start`
3. Ensure your `kubectl` context is set to the cluster you created:
    - `kubectl config use-context minikube`
4. In a separate terminal, use a [9P mount](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/handbook/mount/) to mount the directory containing your data and models to an alias called `/ri-platform/local` on the virtual nodes.
    - `minikube mount <ABSOLUTE PATH ON LOCAL FILESYSTEM>:/ri-platform/local`
    - This will create a long running process that *must be kept alive* for the mount to work properly!

## Installation and Validation
After satisfying the requirements above, the installation and validation process for the Local Agent is identical to that of agents running on cloud providers.

To proceed with the installation, follow the steps in [Installation](../installation.rst) for the `Local Agent` option in the self-guided installation process.

Upon completion, proceed to [Using the Local Agent](usage.md).
