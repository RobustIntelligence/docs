# Data Access Permissions
The **data plane** agent uses a K8s service account called `rime-agent-model-tester` for read access to the data and models you wish to use.

## AWS EKS + S3
Our recommended authentication approach for this pattern is [IAM roles for service accounts (IRSA)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/iam-roles-for-service-accounts.html).

1. If not already configured for your cluster, be sure to create an IAM OpenID Connect (OIDC) provider for your cluster to use IAM roles for service accounts.
    - [Creating an IAM OIDC provider for your cluster](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/enable-iam-roles-for-service-accounts.html)
2. Create a designated S3 bucket for your Robust Intelligence cluster. This will serve as the agent's default data source.
    - [Creating a bucket](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/create-bucket-overview.html)
3. Create the following read access policy for the designated S3 bucket(s).
    ```json
    {
      "Version": "2012-10-17",
      "Statement": [
          {
              "Effect": "Allow",
              "Action": [
                  "s3:ListBucket"
              ],
              "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::<YOUR_BUCKET>"
          },
          {
              "Effect": "Allow",
              "Action": [
                  "s3:GetObject"
              ],
              "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::<YOUR_BUCKET>/*"
          }
      ]
    }
    ```
4. Create an IAM role that the `rime-agent-model-tester` K8s service account can assume, and associate it with the policy created in the previous step.
    - **Save this ARN. You will need to specify this during the agent setup step.**
5. Create a trust relationship to allow the K8s service account to assume the IAM role.
    - [Configuring a K8s service account to assume an IAM role](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/associate-service-account-role.html)

## GCP GKE + GCS
Our recommended authentication approach for this pattern is [Workload Identity](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/workload-identity).

1. Ensure that your GKE cluster has Workload Identity enabled.
    - [Enable Workload Identity](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/workload-identity#enable)
2. Create a designated GCS bucket for your Robust Intelligence cluster. This will serve as the agent's default data source.
    - [Create buckets](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/creating-buckets)
3. Create an IAM service account and grant it role(s) that have `storage.buckets.get` and `storage.objects.get` permissions.
    - [IAM roles for Cloud Storage](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/access-control/iam-roles)
    - **Save the service account email. You will need to specify this during the agent setup step.**
4. Add IAM policy binding between the IAM service account and the K8s service account `rime-agent-model-tester` with role `roles/iam.workloadIdentityUser`.
    - [Use Workload Identity](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/workload-identity#authenticating_to)

## Azure AKS + Blob Storage
Our recommended authentication approach for this pattern is [Azure AD Workload Identity](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/workload-identity-overview).

1. Ensure that your AKS cluster has Workload Identity enabled.
    - [Enable Workload Identity](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/workload-identity-deploy-cluster)
2. Create a designated blob container for your Robust Intelligence cluster. This will serve as the agent's default data source.
    - [Manage containers](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/blob-containers-portal)
3. Create a managed identity and associate it with the blob container from the previous step.
    - [Create a managed identity](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/workload-identity-deploy-cluster#create-a-managed-identity)
    - **Save the Client ID (and your [Tenant ID](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/partner-center/find-ids-and-domain-names)). You will need to specify these during the agent setup step.**
4. Create a role assignment to give your managed identity permissions to read from your blob storage container.
    - A suitable Azure-provided role is `Storage Blob Data Reader`.
        - [Assign an Azure role for access to blob data](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/assign-azure-role-data-access?tabs=portal)
    - [Assign Azure roles to a managed identity](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/role-assignments-portal-managed-identity)
5. Create a federated identity credential to associate the `rime-agent-model-tester` service account with your managed identity.
    - [Establish federated identity credential](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/workload-identity-deploy-cluster#establish-federated-identity-credential)

## Other Cloud Providers
If you are using a different cloud provider or want to specify the service account directly, you can specify other configurations via the `rimeAgent.modelTestJob.serviceAccount` Helm values.
