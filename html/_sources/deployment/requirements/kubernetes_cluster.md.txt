# Kubernetes Cluster

The **data plane** agent is installed via Helm on your Kubernetes cluster.

- You (the admin) must have proper permissions to interact with the cluster via Helm and `kubectl`.
- Recommended to have nodes with 32GiB+ memory. For AWS EC2, this would be a `2xlarge` instances.
- Cluster must allow containers to make external network calls to the RI Platform.
- Cluster must have nodes that the agent and launched jobs can be scheduled on (i.e. without NoSchedule taints).
