Welcome to RIME!
================================

The Robust Intelligence Model Engine (RIME) enables comprehensive testing of data and 
model performance at the pre-development and post-development stages of the model life 
cycle.

RIME documentation covers several broad topic areas. If you're new to RIME or
want to familiarize yourself with core concepts of machine learning, **RIME at a Glance**
provides an overview.

The most recent version of this documentation is always available `here <https://docs.rime.dev/en/latest/>`_.

To find information on how to achieve day-to-day data science tasks with RIME, look in 
the **Testing and monitoring models with RIME** section, which discusses actively using RIME to evaluate
datasets and models. Configuring alerts, setting up integrations, and running tests on
uploaded models are all discussed here.

.. TODO actually make the security section
   The **RIME Security** section discusses RIME's approach to authentication, authorization, encryption, and audit functionality.

**Administering RIME** discusses tasks related to the maintenance and administration of 
an RIME instance, including user account management, role assignments, authentication
systems, and API access.

RIME instances are available as cloud installations, either fully managed by 
Robust Intelligence or directly managed by you. RIME can also be installed
as a stand-alone, self-hosted application. The installation process is discussed in 
**Installing RIME**.

The **Reference** section contains in-depth details about the Python SDK, including 
detailed JSON templates to configure stress testing for RIME.
