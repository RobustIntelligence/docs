Installation
================================

RIME can be installed in different ways, depending on your needs.

For most use cases, we suggest using **RIME Cloud**, our most lightweight installation.
Users need only install our python SDK to get started with the cloud product,
and we will manage the cluster for you.

Alternatively, we support cloud integrations with **RIME Enterprise**, an installation
that we will conduct with your DevOps team to set up a RIME Kubernetes cluster
in your VPC.
