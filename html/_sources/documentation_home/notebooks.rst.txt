Tutorial Notebooks
===================

These notebooks illustrate how to use Robust Intelligence to validate, protect, and monitor your ML pipeline across a wide range of tasks, from classification to ranking, and across tabular, natural language processing (NLP), and computer vision (CV) data modalities.

Each notebook walks through the steps of setting up Robust Intelligence with an example dataset/model then running a Stress Test or Continuous Test on the model. The datasets and models used in these examples come from well-known public sources such as `UCI ML <https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/adult-census-income>`_ or `arXiv <https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/Cornell-University/arxiv?select=arxiv-metadata-oai-snapshot.json>`_


Tabular Notebooks
------------------
Tabular tests are performed on table-formatted data. Generally speaking, data that
consists of a list of records with various attributes for a given data can be considered
tabular.

NLP Notebooks
--------------

NLP models attempt to correctly parse human speech, recognize entities being referred to
by that speech, and analyze implied qualities of that speech, such as emotional subtext.

CV Notebooks
-------------

CV models attempt to interpret images to discern specific objects within the image or
generally classify the contents of an image.

Bias and Fairness Notebooks
----------------------------

Stress Testing and Continuous Testing allows you to verify your AI model for bias and fairness issues.
These two notebooks walk through using Robust Intelligence for a compliance use case:

REST API Notebooks
-------------------

Although we provide a :ref:`Python SDK<rime-sdk>` for interacting with Robust Intelligence, you can also use the REST API directly. This notebook demonstrates how to use the API to run a Stress Test and query the results.

Set Up Your Own Test Run
-------------------------

For further guides on setting up your own test run, begin with the following guide:

Once you have your model set up, you can run a Stress Test or Continuous Test using the SDK, Web UI or REST API:
