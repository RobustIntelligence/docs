# Installation

The following steps demonstrate how to get started with the Robust Intelligence platform using a Python SDK client.

1. [Deploy a Robust Intelligence cluster](../deployment/index.rst)

    * The URL of your cluster is needed to initialize programmatic clients such as the SDK. The URL is typically in the form `rime.{}.rbst.io`. Consult your
      site administrator with questions about your cluster URL.

2. Create an [API token](../administration/security_and_compliance/api_tokens.md) for your Workspace

    * Tokens are used to connect programmatically to the Robust Intelligence cluster.
      You can create your own API Token by going to `Settings` -> `API Access Tokens` in the Web UI.

3. Install the [RIME SDK](../reference/python-sdk.rst) with `pip install rime-sdk`

    * The RIME SDK is a Python package for interacting with Robust Intelligence programmatically. If your cluster is on an older version of Robust Intelligence, you can install a specific
      version with `pip install rime-sdk==X.Y.Z`.

4. Create an SDK Client
    * Requires the cluster URL and an API token to initialize.


Once Robust Intelligence has been installed and an SDK client has been created, you will need to create projects and [register your datasets and models](../testing_and_monitoring/preparing_your_models_and_datasets.rst) before running tests on your models.
