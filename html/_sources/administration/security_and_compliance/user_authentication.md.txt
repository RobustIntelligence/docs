4.  Click the three-dot icon at the right of a user and select *Reset Password*.
    >   The Reset Password dialog box appears.
5.  In *Current Passsword*, type the current password for the user account.
6.  In *New Password*, type the new password.
7.  In *Confirm Password*, type the new password again.
