# Test Results Data Retention

Customers test results live on the [control plane](../../deployment/index.rst). Robust Intelligence allows you to configure the data retention period for
storing test results on the control plane. This feature enables the retention of
test results data for a specified duration, after which the system automatically deletes
the data. By default, test results data is stored indefinitely,
but with this feature, users can choose to set a retention period that suits
their needs. Once the retention period expires, the system automatically removes any test results data that
exceeds the specified duration.

**Note:** Only Test Results can be configured to be deleted. This includes stress testing,
continuous testing, and model card results. However, the following are not deleted -
Settings (Organization, Workspace, Project), Artifact Identifiers (Feature names,
Test names, Unique IDs, Paths, Result Names, etc), and Configurations (Test configs, Thresholds, etc).
