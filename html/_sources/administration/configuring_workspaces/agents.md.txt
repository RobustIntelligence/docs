# Agents

An agent is a lightweight Kubernetes deployment that runs testing jobs
within a [workspace](workspaces.md). A workspace must be assigned at least one
agent, and a given agent can be assigned to multiple workspaces. A workspace
must have a default agent specified. Jobs are run with the default agent when
an agent is not specified for that job.

Agent creation and management is restricted to users with the Organization
Administrator [role](../security_and_compliance/user_account_roles.md).

Agent configuration during deploy is discussed in [Agent Configuration](../../deployment/installation.rst).



## Viewing the agent status page

The agent status page is available to all members of a workspace and displays the status of all agents assigned to the workspace.
