# Agents
A model testing agent is a compute resource in your cloud environment (also referred to as the **Data Plane**) that runs testing jobs.
These agents work in tandem with a Robust Intelligence management hub (also referred to as the **Control Plane**) to coordinate their workloads.

For more details on architecture, see [Cloud Architecture](../../deployment/index.rst).

Only users with the [Organization Administrator role](../security_and_compliance/user_account_roles.md) are able to configure agents for their Workspaces.

## Managing Agents for the Organization
**NOTE: The following actions apply for the entire Organization, affecting all Workspaces at once.**

### Creating an Agent
Creating an agent is covered in the [Deployment](../../deployment/index.rst) section.

### Deactivating an Agent for your Organization
A deactivated agent is unable to execute workloads; however, it is still connected to your Robust Intelligence instance.

1. Navigate to the Robust Intelligence homepage by clicking the logo in the top-left corner.
    > The Workspace summary page appears.
2. Select **Settings** > **Organization Settings** in the lower left corner.
    > The Organization Settings page appears.
3.  Click **Manage Agent Setup**.
    > The Agents Setup pane appears.
4.  From the three-dot menu to the right of an agent, select the **Deactivate** option.
    > A confirmation dialog box appears.
5.  Click the **Deactivate Agent** button to confirm.
    > The agent's status will now be marked as `Deactivated`.

### Removing an Agent from your Organization
To completely remove an agent from your Robust Intelligence installation, follow the steps below.

After disconnecting the agent from Robust Intelligence, you will have to manually uninstall it from the relevant Kubernetes cluster in your cloud environment.

1. Navigate to the Robust Intelligence homepage by clicking the logo in the top-left corner.
    > The Workspace summary page appears.
2. Select **Settings** > **Organization Settings** in the lower left corner.
    > The Organization Settings page appears.
3.  Click **Manage Agent Setup**.
    > The Agents Setup pane appears.
4.  From the three-dot menu to the right of an agent, select the **Remove** option.
    > A confirmation dialog box appears.
5.  Click the **Remove Agent** button to confirm.
    > The agent will no longer appear in the table.

## Managing Agents for Workspaces

### Viewing the Agent Status Page
The agent status page displays the current status of all agents assigned to the workspace.
It is viewable by all members of a Workspace.

1. Select a Workspace.
    > The Workspace summary page appears.
2. Select **Workspace Settings** under the **Settings** icon in the lower left corner.
    > The Workspace Settings page appears.
3. Click **Agent Status**.

The list of agents assigned to this workspace appears, along with the status of each agent.

### Adding an Agent to a Workspace
Because agents have connectivity to data sources, they must be explicitly added to Workspaces to ensure that only approved users can utilize them.

A Workspace must be assigned at least one agent, and a given agent can be assigned to multiple Workspaces.
Jobs are run with the default agent unless otherwise specified in the request.

1. Select a Workspace.
    > The Workspace summary page appears.
2. Select **Settings** > **Workspace Settings** in the lower left corner.
    > The Workspace Settings page appears.
3. Under **General** > **Select Agents**, select the agents you would like to configure.
    > Selected agents will have a blue checkmark beside their name.
4. Click the **Save** button to apply your changes.

### Removing an Agent from a Workspace
Follow the same process as above, but de-select the relevant agent(s) and then click **Save**.
