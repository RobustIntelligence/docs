# AWS Data Stores

Robust Intelligence supports loading data directly from AWS. Today, S3 is the only natively supported Cloud Store. Configure
AWS Data Stores [using the UI.](../configuring_integrations.md)



## Configuring AWS Data Stores Integration

In order to configure the AWS Data Store Integration, there are 2 authentication methods:

### Access Key Based Authentication

In order to configure AWS Data Stores via access key based authentication,
you need to enter the following information:

1. Access Key ID
2. Secret Access Key

You can find more information by the following this [AWS Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/powershell/latest/userguide/pstools-appendix-sign-up.html)

### IAM Roles for Service Accounts Based Authentication

Integrations support authenticating using AWS Role ARN in the same way
when deploying the [Agent.](../../../../deployment/requirements.rst)

To enable the integration using Role ARN, you only need to associate the
service accounts `rime-agent-model-tester` with the agents where you intend
to use the integration. You can find more information by following this
[AWS Guide.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/associate-service-account-role.html)

**Note:** You do not need to update the service account `rime-agent-model-tester`
with the new Role ARN as this will be updated during runtime when the integration is used.

## Using the AWS Integration

After configuring the integration, use it to register datasets and models.

```
integration_id = "abe23******" #Choose the AWS Integraiton ID

project.register_dataset(
    name= f"ref_data_{dt}",
    data_config= {
        "connection_info": {
            "data_file": {
                "path": "s3://rime-blob-integration/data/fraud_ref.csv" #Enter the s3 file path
            }
        },
        "data_params": {"label_col": "label"}
    },
    integration_id= integration_id
)

model_id = project.register_model(
    name= f"model_{dt}",
    model_config= {
        "model_path": {
            "path": "s3://rime-blob-integration/models/fraud_model.py" #Enter the s3 file path
        }
    },
    integration_id= integration_id
)
```

More information on defining
the configurations is available in the
[Data Configuration](../../../../testing_and_monitoring/preparing_your_models_and_datasets/data_source.md) section.
