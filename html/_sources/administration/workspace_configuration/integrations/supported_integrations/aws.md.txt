# AWS Data Stores

Robust Intelligence supports loading data directly from AWS. Today, S3 is the only natively supported Cloud Store. Configure
AWS Data Stores [using the UI.](../configuring_integrations.md)



## Configuring AWS Data Store Integration

To integrate Robust Intelligence with an AWS Data Store, you must configure one of the following authentication methods:

- [Access Key Based Authentication](#access-key-based-authentication); or
- [IAM Role-Based Authentication](#iam-role-based-authentication)
- [IAM Cross-Account Access](#iam-cross-account-access)

See the relevant steps for your approach below.

After you've configured your AWS data store integration, see
[Using the AWS Integration](#using-the-aws-integration) for help
registering your datasets and models.

### Access Key-Based Authentication

In order to configure an AWS Data Store that Robust Intelligence will
connect to using access key-based authentication, follow the steps
below. This procedure will provide the **Access Key ID** and **Secret
Access Key** that you need when you create the Robust Intelligence-ASW
integration.

You can learn more about access key based authentication in the AWS
document,
[AWS Account and Access Keys](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/powershell/latest/userguide/pstools-appendix-sign-up.html)

**Procedure:**

1. Create or find the AWS bucket that your Robust Intelligence
   instance will use. This will serve as the agent's default data source.
   See the AWS document, [Creating a bucket](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/create-bucket-overview.html).

1. Create a policy to *get and list objects* for the designated S3
   bucket. This will be similar to the policy shown here:

    ```json
    {
      "Version": "2012-10-17",
      "Statement": [
          {
              "Effect": "Allow",
              "Action": [
                  "s3:ListBucket"
              ],
              "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::<YOUR_BUCKET>"
          },
          {
              "Effect": "Allow",
              "Action": [
                  "s3:GetObject"
              ],
              "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::<YOUR_BUCKET>/*"
          }
      ]
    }
    ```

1. Add the policy to the relevant user group. See the AWS document,
   [Attaching a policy to an IAM user group](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_groups_manage_attach-policy.html)

    **Note:** If you do not want to create a new user, proceed to Step 5.

1. If needed, add and/or create users in this user group. See the AWS document on
   [Adding and removing users](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_groups_manage_add-remove-users.html)

1. Get the access key as explained in the AWS document,
   [Get your access key ID and secret access key](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/powershell/latest/userguide/pstools-appendix-sign-up.html).

   Once you have the access key:

   - If you did *not* create a new user, then
     copy the **Access Key ID** and **Secret Access Key**.
     You'll need these when you configure the integration
     in the next step.

   - If you *did* create a new user, then you must create
     the access key for the new user. See the section, "To create an
     access key" in the AWS document,
     [Managing access keys](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_access-keys.html?icmpid=docs_iam_console#Using_CreateAccessKey).

1. Add your AWS integration through the
   [Robust Intelligence UI: Workspace: Integrations: Add](../configuring_integrations.md#add-an-integration-through-the-robust-intelligence-web-ui).


### IAM Role-Based Authentication

In order to configure an AWS Data Store that Robust Intelligence will
connect to using IAM role-based authentication, follow the steps below.
This procedure will provide the **AWS Role ARN** that you will need
when you create the Robust Intelligence-AWS integration.
Learn more about IAM role-based access in the AWS document,
[Configuring a Kubernetes service account to assume an IAM role](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/associate-service-account-role.html).

**Note:** Integrations support authenticating using AWS Role ARN in
the same way when deploying the
[Robust Intelligence Agent](../../../../deployment/requirements/data_access_permissions.md).

**Procedure:**

1. Create or find the AWS bucket that your Robust Intelligence
   instance will use. For information, see the AWS document,
   [Creating a bucket](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/create-bucket-overview.html).

1. If not already configured for your cluster, create an IAM OpenID
   Connect (OIDC) provider that will enable your cluster to use IAM
   roles for service accounts. See the AWS document,
   [Creating an IAM OIDC provider for your cluster](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/enable-iam-roles-for-service-accounts.html)

1. For the designated S3 bucket, create an access policy that allows
   *listing* and *reading* objects:

    ```json
    {
      "Version": "2012-10-17",
      "Statement": [
          {
              "Effect": "Allow",
              "Action": [
                  "s3:ListBucket"
              ],
              "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::<YOUR_BUCKET>"
          },
          {
              "Effect": "Allow",
              "Action": [
                  "s3:GetObject"
              ],
              "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::<YOUR_BUCKET>/*"
          }
      ]
    }
    ```

1. Create an IAM role that the two K8s service accounts (see top of
   page) can assume, and associate it with the policy created in the
   previous step.

   **Save this ARN. You will need to specify this during the Robust
   Intelligence integration setup step.**

1. Create a trust relationship to allow the two K8s service accounts
   to assume the IAM role. See the AWS document,
   [Configuring a K8s service account to assume an IAM role](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/associate-service-account-role.html)

   Your trust relationship should have a similar definition as the
   template shown below. Note the two K8s service accounts in the subject
   field.

   **Note:** You do *not* need to update the service account
   `rime-agent-model-tester` and `rime-agent-rime-cross-plane-server`
   with the new Role ARN as this will be populated at runtime when
   the integration is used.

    ```json
    {
        "Version": "2012-10-17",
        "Statement": [
            {
                "Effect": "Allow",
                "Principal": {
                    "Federated": "arn:aws:iam::111122223333:oidc-provider/oidc.eks.region-code.amazonaws.com/id/EXAMPLED539D4633E53DE1B71EXAMPLE"
                },
                "Action": "sts:AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity",
                "Condition": {
                    "StringEquals": {
                        "oidc.eks.region-code.amazonaws.com/id/EXAMPLED539D4633E53DE1B71EXAMPLE:sub": [
                            "system:serviceaccount:$AGENT_NAMESPACE:rime-agent-rime-cross-plane-server",
                            "system:serviceaccount:$AGENT_NAMESPACE:rime-agent-model-tester"
                        ]
                    }
                }
            }
        ]
    }
    ```

    See also the AWS document,
    [Configuring role and service account](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/associate-service-account-role.html).

1. Add your AWS integration through the
   [Robust Intelligence UI: Workspace: Integrations: Add](../configuring_integrations.md#add-an-integration-through-the-robust-intelligence-web-ui).


### IAM Cross-Account Access

If your data resides in an S3 bucket owned by a user other than the
main AWS service account you use for your Robust Intelligence-to-S3 data
integration, then you can use IAM cross-account access to load that
data. The steps below explain how to set this up.

```{admonition} Note
The steps below are based on the
[cross-account permissions walkthrough](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/example-walkthroughs-managing-access-example2.html#access-policies-walkthrough-cross-account-permissions-acctA-tasks) in the AWS documentation.
```

#### Overview

In these instructions, we'll use the following example account
names:

- *Account A* is the AWS account that owns the S3 bucket whose data you wish
  to load.

- *Account B* is the AWS account of the user who wants to load data
  for test runs in Robust Intelligence. A user in this account will be
  set up as the Robust Intelligence integration service account as
  explained in [IAM Role-Based Authentication](#iam-role-based-authentication).

#### Procedure

1. Create a role in Account B and give it the permissions to be
   received from Account A:
   - Sign in as an administrator of Account B (the account that wants
     access to the data).
   - Create a role that will be granted the bucket access permissions
     received from Account A. Here we give our example role the name,
     `cross-account-rw-accountA-rime-blob-bucket-role`.
   - Create an inline policy for this role, granting permission to
     perform the actions `s3:ListBucket`, `s3:GetBucketLocation`,
     `s3:GetObject`, `s3:PutObject`, and `s3:DeleteObject` on the
     bucket. Here, we use the example bucket ARN,
     `arn:aws:s3:::accountA-rime-blob-bucket`.
     Replace this with your bucket's ARN.

     ```json
     {
         "Version": "2012-10-17",
         "Statement": [
             {
                 "Effect": "Allow",
                 "Action": [
                     "s3:ListBucket",
                     "s3:GetBucketLocation"
                 ],
                 "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::accountA-rime-blob-bucket"
             },
             {
                 "Effect": "Allow",
                 "Action": [
                     "s3:GetObject",
                     "s3:PutObject",
                     "s3:DeleteObject"
                 ],
                 "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::accountA-rime-blob-bucket/*"
             }
         ]
     }
     ```

   - You can view the role and its access policy in the AWS Console:
     <br />
     <img src="../../../../_static/images/iam-cross-acct-role.png" style="max-height:400px">

2. Create a bucket policy that grants Account B access to Account A's bucket:
   - Using the IAM user sign-in URL for Account A, first sign in to the
     AWS Management Console as an admin user.
   - Attach a bucket policy (see example below) to the bucket to grant
     Account B permission to perform the actions `s3:ListBucket`,
     `s3:GetBucketLocation`, `s3:GetObject`, `s3:PutObject`, and
     `s3:DeleteObject`. Specifically, grant the permissions to the
     role you defined earlier in Account B (which uses the example
     account ID, `111122223333`). Replace the example bucket ARN,
     `arn:aws:s3:::accountA-rime-blob-bucket`, with your bucket's ARN.

     ```json
     {
         "Version": "2012-10-17",
         "Statement": [
             {
                 "Principal": {
                     "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::111122223333:role/cross-account-rw-accountA-rime-blob-bucket-role"
                 },
                 "Effect": "Allow",
                 "Action": [
                     "s3:ListBucket",
                     "s3:GetBucketLocation"
                 ],
                 "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::accountA-rime-blob-bucket"
             },
             {
                 "Principal": {
                     "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::111122223333:role/cross-account-rw-accountA-rime-blob-bucket-role"
                 },
                 "Effect": "Allow",
                 "Action": [
                     "s3:GetObject",
                     "s3:PutObject",
                     "s3:DeleteObject"
                 ],
                 "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::accountA-rime-blob-bucket/*"
             }
         ]
     }
     ```

     - Use the AWS CLI to verify that the policy is working and allows
       an admin user in Account B (user `AccountBadmin` in this
       example) to list the bucket's contents. In Account B, switch
       to the IAM role you created for the bucket access (see the AWS
       instructions, [Switching to an IAM role](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_use_switch-role-cli.html)).
       Then test that you can access Account A's bucket. Here,
       we show the example bucket, `accountA-rime-blob-bucket`:

       ```shell
       aws s3 ls s3://accountA-rime-blob-bucket
       ```

3. Create an AWS S3 Integration in Robust Intelligence using the role
   you just created. For instructions, see
   [IAM Role-Based Authentication](#iam-role-based-authentication), above.

   Once you've created the integration, you can use it as explained in
   [Using the AWS Integration](#using-the-aws-integration).

## Using the AWS Integration

After configuring the integration, use it to register datasets and models. When registering datasets, the `path` field can point to files of type `csv`, Parquet, `jsonl`, `jsonl.gz`, and `json.gz`. In this case, `data_type` does not need to be specified and defaults to `"DATA_TYPE_UNSPECIFIED"`.

```python
integration_id = "abe23******" #Choose the AWS Integration ID

project.register_dataset(
    name= f"ref_data_{dt}",
    data_config= {
        "connection_info": {
            "data_file": {
                "path": "s3://rime-blob-integration/data/fraud_ref.csv" #Enter the s3 file path
            }
        },
        "data_params": {"label_col": "label"}
    },
    integration_id= integration_id
)

model_id = project.register_model(
    name= f"model_{dt}",
    model_config= {
        "model_path": {
            "path": "s3://rime-blob-integration/models/fraud_model.py" #Enter the s3 file path
        }
    },
    integration_id= integration_id
)
```

The AWS integration can also be used to register a Delta lake table on
S3. The path mush point to the S3 folder where the Delta lake table
exists and the `"data_type": "DATA_TYPE_DELTA_TABLE"` must be
specified.

```python
integration_id = "abe23******" #Choose the AWS Integration ID

project.register_dataset(
    name= f"ref_data_{dt}",
    data_config= {
        "connection_info": {
            "data_file": {
                "path": "s3://rime-blob-integration/data/delta_table/fraud_ref", #Enter the delta table path on s3
                "data_type": "DATA_TYPE_DELTA_TABLE"
            }
        },
        "data_params": {"label_col": "label"}
    },
    integration_id= integration_id
)
```

More information on defining
the configurations is available in the
[Data Configuration](../../../../testing_and_monitoring/preparing_your_models_and_datasets/data_source.md) section.
