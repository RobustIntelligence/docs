# Configuring Integrations

Administrators can configure integrations for a Robust Intelligence instance. Integrations can provide
data or compute resources to Robust Intelligence.

All configured integrations can be managed from the *Integrations* tab in Workspace settings. Only workspace
administrators and organization administrators are allowed to configure and update integrations. Once an
integration is configured all workspace member will be able to see and use the integrations.

The new integration is now available to the RI Platform.

## Adding Cloud Object Storage during deployment.

Cloud Object Storage (e.g., AWS S3, Azure Blob Storage, or Google Cloud Storage) can also be configured during deployment time. A default Object Storage needs to be configured during deployment. These do not appear in the Integrations UI.
