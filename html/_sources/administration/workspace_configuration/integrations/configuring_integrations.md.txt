# Configuring Integrations

Administrators can add and manage integrations in a workspace. Robust
Intelligence uses saved integrations to load data and compute
resources.

All configured integrations can be managed from the *Integrations*
panel in Workspace settings. Only workspace administrators and
organization administrators can add and update integrations. Once an
integration is configured, all workspace members will be able to see
and use the integration.

The *Integrations* panel also displays preconfigured integrations,
namely the *Huggingface* and *Agent* Integrations, which are read-only
and cannot be updated by users. The Agent Integrations display the
suffix, `(Agent)`, and the list of integrations contains information
about the cloud agents added to the workspace.

## Add an integration through the Robust Intelligence web UI

An administrator can add or modify a data integration that the Robust
Intelligence instance can use for loading datasets and other resources.

1. Sign in to a Robust Intelligence instance or click *Workspaces* in
   the right navigation panel.
1. In the Workspaces page, click the name of your workspace
1. Click the gear icon at the lower left of the window and choose
   *Workspace Settings*.
1. In the Workspace Settings page, click *Integrations* in the navigation panel.
1. In the Integrations configuration panel, click *Add Integration*.
1. In the Add Integration dialog box, specify the following:
   - A *Name*, type a name for this integration
   - An *Integration Type* such as:
     - AWS S3
     - Azure Blobstore
     - Databricks Deltalake
     - HuggingFace
     - Custom
   - Fill in the necessary fields depending on the integration.
1. (Optional) Click *Add Variable* to add secrets as key/value pairs.
   - In *Key* and *Value*, type a key name and the value for that key.
   - In the *Sensitivity* drop-down, select a sensitivity level for
     the key/value pair. This is one of: `Not sensitive`, `Workspace`
     level, or `Members` level. Information you mark as sensitive (for
     example, access tokens) will be stored in a secrets manager
     service built using
     [Hashicorp Vault](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/docs/what-is-vault).
     If the sensitivity is `Members` level, individual members must
     individually configure their sensitive credentials for this
     integration. If the sensitivity is `Workspace` level, the
     administrator configures the sensitive credentials for this
     integration.
1. Click *Save Integration*.

The new integration is now available to the RI Platform.

**Tip!** Once you've saved a data integration, you can copy its
integration UUID from the **ID** column of the **Workspace Settings:
Integrations** panel.

## Get the UUID of a saved integration

Follow these steps to find the ID (UUID) of a saved integration:

1. Sign in to a Robust Intelligence instance and click *Workspaces* in
   the right navigation panel.
1. In the Workspaces page, click the name of your workspace.
1. Click the gear icon at the lower left of the window and choose
   *Workspace Settings*.
1. In the Workspace Settings page, click *Integrations* in the navigation panel.
1. In the Integrations configuration panel, scroll to find you data integration.
1. Copy its integration UUID from the **ID** column.

## Provide integration credentials through the Robust Intelligence web UI

When an integration requires Member Level credentials, each user needs to enter their own credentials.

1. Sign in to a Robust Intelligence instance.
    >   The Workspaces page appears.
2. Click the three-dot menu at the right side of a workspace and select *Manage Workspace*.
    >   Alternately, select *Workspace Settings* from a workspace page.
    >   The Workspace Settings page appears.
3. Click *Integrations* in the left navigation bar.
    >   The Integrations configuration pane appears.
4. Select an integration from the list where *Credential Status* is *Not Configured*
5. Click the three-dot menu and select *Edit Integration*.
6. Fill in the necessary field value where *Sensitvity* is *Member Level*.
7. Click *Save Integration*.

The new integration is now available to the RI Platform.

## Add Cloud Object Storage during deployment

Cloud Object Storage (e.g., AWS S3, Azure Blob Storage, or Google Cloud Storage) can also be configured during deployment time. A default Object Storage needs to be configured during deployment. These do not appear in the Integrations UI.
