# Workspaces

A workspace is an environment for organizing and accessing all of your Robust
Intelligence assets. All the Robust Intelligence assets in a workspace are
unique to that workspace.

A workspace must be assigned at least one [agent](agents.md). A given agent can be assigned to
multiple workspaces. A workspace must have a default agent specified. Jobs are run
with the default agent when an agent is not specified for that job.

User accounts with the correct privileges can create, edit, and remove workspaces. These privileges depend on the user account [role](../security_and_compliance/user_account_roles.md) and [RBAC](../security_and_compliance/rbac.md) level.

## Creating a Workspace

1.  Sign in to a user account that has administrative privileges for an RI
    Platform instance.
    >   The Workspaces page appears.
2.  Click *Create Workspace*.
    >   The Create New Workspace dialog box appears.
3.  In *Name*, type a name for the workspace.
4.  (Optional) In *Description*, type a description for the workspace.
5.  From the *Agent Setup* drop-down, select a set of agents.
6.  From the list of selected agents, click *Set as Default* for the default agent.
    >   When only one agent is selected, the RI Platform automatically assigns
    >   that agent as the default agent for the workspace.
7.  (Optional) Click the *Members* tab.
    >   The Members tab appears.
8.  In the *Add Team Members* field, type a username or email address and click *Add*.
    >   Skip this step when omitting the optional previous step. Granting membership
    >   after workspace creation is discussed in [Role-based Access Contro](../security_and_compliance/rbac.md).
7.  Click *Create*.

The workspace is ready to use.

## Editing a Workspace

1.  Sign in to a user account that has administrative privileges for an RI
    Platform instance.
    >   The Workspaces page appears.
2.  Click the three-dot menu to the right of the workspace name and select *Manage Workspace*.
    >   The Workspace Settings page appears with the General tab selected.
3.  In the *General* pane, make changes and click *Save*.

The workspace settings are changed. Changes to [workspace membership](../security_and_compliance/rbac.md), [API access tokens](../security_and_compliance/api_tokens.md),
[managed images](../organization_administration/managed_images.md), [agents](agents.md), and [integrations](integrations/configuring_integrations.md) are discussed in their respective sections.

## Removing a Workspace

1.  Sign in to a user account that has administrative privileges for an RI
    Platform instance.
    >   The Workspaces page appears.
2.  Click the three-dot menu to the right of the workspace name and select *Remove*.
    >   A confirmation dialog box appears.
3.  Click *Remove Workspace*.

The RI Platform instance deletes the workspace, along with all projects and test runs in that workspace.
