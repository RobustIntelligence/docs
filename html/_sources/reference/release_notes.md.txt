# Release Notes

For notes on upgrades and deprecations to the Robust Intelligence REST
API, refer to the [API changelog](../reference/api_changelog.md).

Unless noted otherwise, you must [upgrade](../deployment/upgrade.rst)
all Robust Intelligence components to take advantage of the changes
listed here.

## 2.4

### AWS Terraform Provider Upgraded to >= 4.47.0, < 5.0.0 for rime_eks_cluster Module

This change only affects customers upgrading self-hosted instances of Robust Intelligence.
When using Terraform to upgrade to a 2.4 or higher version of the `rime_eks_cluster` Terraform module, you must now use a version of the AWS Terraform provider that is >= 4.47.0 and < 5.0.0.

### AWS Load Balancer Controller Upgraded to 2.6.1

The AWS Loadbalancer Controller has been upgraded to version 2.6.1.
This includes updates to its Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs).

You will need to remirror the image and update your deployment if
using a private docker registry. This image can be found at
`docker.io/robustintelligencehq/aws-alb-ingress-controller:v2.6.1`

Upgrade actions:
- If you're performing a fresh installation you do not need to do
  anything.

- If you're using RI Platform Helm charts you also do not need to
  take any different actions.

- If you're not using Helm though and upgrading to RI Platform
  version 2.4 from an earlier version follow these directions:

  Update CRDs to the ones that are bundled with AWS Loadbalancer
  version 2.6.1:
  ```
  $ kubectl apply -k "github.com/aws/eks-charts/stable/aws-load-balancer-controller//crds?ref=v0.0.150"
  ```

## 2.3

### Firewall API deprecated and replaced with new `ContinuousTest` class and methods

In v2.3 of the SDK, the new `ContinuousTest` class replaces the
`Firewall` class. The v1/firewall API and the associated Python SDK
methods were deprecated as of v2.2 and will not be supported starting
in v2.4. Please convert your code to use the new `ContinuousTest`
class and methods.

The deprecated `Firewall` API and SDK classes and methods have been
renamed to incorporate the name `ct` to better indicate that they're
used for running and managing continuous tests. The new and renamed
classes and methods include:

- `ContinuousTest`
- `Client.create_ct()`
- `Client.has_ct()`
- `Client.get_ct()`
- `Client.delete_ct()`
- `Client.get_ct_for_project()`
- `Project.update_ct_categories()`

### File scanning

This release adds the ability to scan model artifacts for
vulnerabilities. Once a model has been registered with Robust
Intelligence, you can run a file scan on the model artifacts. The scan
identifies any potentially dangerous imports in the model which
pose risks during de-serialization. This is a critical step in
securing your model supply chain. See
[File Scanning](../testing_and_monitoring/preparing_your_models_and_datasets/file_scanning.md)
for details


### Ingress-Nginx Changes

This release bumps the Ingress-Nginx version to v1.8.1. You will need
to remirror the image and update your deployment if using a private
docker registry. This image can be found at
`docker.io/robustintelligencehq/ingress-nginx-controller:v1.8.1`.

### AWS Load Balancer Controller Upgraded to 2.5.4

The AWS Loadbalancer Controller has been upgraded to version 2.5.4.
This includes updates to its Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs).

You will need to remirror the image and update your deployment if
using a private docker registry. This image can be found at
`docker.io/robustintelligencehq/aws-alb-ingress-controller:v2.5.4`

Upgrade actions:
- If you're performing a fresh installation you do not need to do
  anything.

- If you're using RI Platform Helm charts you also do not need to
  take any different actions.

- If you're not using Helm though and upgrading to RI Platform
  version 2.3 from an earlier version follow these directions:

  Update CRDs to the ones that are bundled with AWS Loadbalancer
  version 2.5.4:
  ```
  $ kubectl apply -k "github.com/aws/eks-charts/stable/aws-load-balancer-controller//crds?ref=v0.0.142"
  ```


## 2.2


### Cleaner separation of continuous test results from monitored event results

Version 2.2 simplifies the way Robust Intelligence shows Continuous
Test results. Continuous Tests are tests that run on a regular
schedule to track model risk and compliance. These now appear in the
[Continuous
Testing](../testing_and_monitoring/monitoring_models/ct_feedback_and_observability.md)
sections of the UI and API. In contrast, we now handle scheduled model
performance tests and scheduled custom tests as Monitors. These
results now appear in the
[Monitors](../testing_and_monitoring/monitoring_models/monitors/monitors.md)
section of the UI.

Model performance results are no longer used in calculating the
risk severity measures that appear in Continuous Test results.

### Firewall API deprecated

The v1/firewall API and the associated Python SDK methods have been deprecated. The endpoints and SDK methods will not be supported from Robust Intelligence v2.4 onwards.

## 2.1

### Category field deprecated

The string `category` field is deprecated in favor of the `test_category` enum field. The string `category` field will be removed in v2.3.
`category` is currently a sub-field of `TestBatchResult`, `TestCase`, and `CategorySummaryMetric`.


### Python 3.7 no longer supported

Robust Intelligence now supports Python 3.8 through Python 3.11. As of
Robust Intelligence 2.1, projects using Python 3.7 are no longer
supported. Projects based on Python 3.7 should be migrated to Python
3.8 or later.


### delta_lake connection_info renamed

The `delta_lake` connection_info has been renamed to `databricks`. This loads a Databricks Delta Lake Table.

Before:
```python
{
    "connection_info": {
        "delta_lake": {
            "table_name": "Table",
        }
    },
    "data_params": ...,
}
```

After:
```python
{
    "connection_info": {
        "databricks": {
            "table_name": "Table",
        }
    },
    "data_params": ...,
}
```


## 2.0 GA


### global_exclude_columns parameter has moved

The location in the Test Suite Configuration to specify the `global_exclude_columns` parameter has changed.

Before:
```python
stress_test_config = {
    # other config params
    "test_suite_config": {
        "individual_tests_config": {
            "global_exclude_columns": ["foo", "bar"]
        }
    }
}
```

After:
```python
stress_test_config = {
    # other config params
    "test_suite_config": {
        "global_exclude_columns": ["foo", "bar"]
    }
}
```

Any existing projects with this parameter specified in the project's Test Suite Configuration may need to be updated with this new version of the configuration.

The specification for the test categories that Robust Intelligence runs has changed, both at a project level and for individual Stress Tests.

Before:
```python
# Update the project's Stress Testing, Continuous Testing categories
project.update_test_suite_config({
	"categories": [
	  {
	      "name": "Model Performance",
	      "run_st": True,
	      "run_ct": True
	  },
	  {
	      "name": "Subset Performance",
	      "run_st": True,
	      "run_ct": False
	  },
	  {
	      "name": "Drift",
	      "run_st": False,
	      "run_ct": True
	  }
	],
	# ...
})

# When running Stress Testing, user can override the project's Stress Testing categories:
stress_test_config = {
    # ... other params in stress test config
    "test_suite_config": {
        "categories": [
            {
                "name": "Bias and Fairness",
                "run_st": True,
                "run_ct": False
            }
        ],
      # ... other params in test suite config
    }
}
```

After:
```python
# Update the project's Stress Testing, Continuous Testing categories
project.update_stress_testing_categories(
    ["TEST_CATEGORY_TYPE_MODEL_PERFORMANCE", "TEST_CATEGORY_TYPE_SUBSET_PERFORMANCE"]
)
project.update_continuous_testing_categories(
    ["TEST_CATEGORY_TYPE_MODEL_PERFORMANCE", "TEST_CATEGORY_TYPE_DRIFT"]
)

# When running Stress Testing, user can override the project's Stress Testing categories:
stress_test_config = {
    # ... other params in stress test config
    "categories": ["TEST_CATEGORY_TYPE_BIAS_AND_FAIRNESS"]
    "test_suite_config": {
      # ... other params in test suite config (if any)
    }
}
```
