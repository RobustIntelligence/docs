# API Authentication 

* In order to authenticate and use the RIME API (Python SDK), users can generate 
an API token from the "API Access Tokens" page under "Workspace Settings". You can 
see how in the below image.
* Each cluster can have up to a maximum of 50 API tokens at one time. 
* The API token will expiry 270 days after creation.
