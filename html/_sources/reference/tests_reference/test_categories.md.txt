# Test Categories
## Drift
Test for differences in the distribution of the reference dataset as compared with the evaluation dataset. If predictions and labels are provided, measure the performance degradation caused by shifting data as well as the drift in predictions and labels themselves.
## Abnormal Inputs
Check the evaluation dataset to verify that it includes sufficient numbers of abnormal values to represent the types of abnormal inputs commonly encountered in production. If model predictions are provided, test whether the evaluation set's abnormal values cause a degradation in your model’s performance.
## Subset Performance
Test that your model performs equally well across different subsets of the evaluation dataset.
## Bias and Fairness
Test that your model does not discriminate or perpetuate stereotypes based on protected features such as gender, race, or disability status. AI models often inherit social biases and other biases from the datasets they're trained on. These tests detect such biases.
## Transformations
Augment your evaluation dataset with synthetic abnormal values to proactively test your pipeline’s error-handling behavior and measure the performance degradation caused by different types of abnormal values.
## Model Performance
Test that your model performs well on the evaluation dataset and is not degrading in performance.
## Data Cleanliness
Test for data reliability by checking that your data is consistent and complete.
## Adversarial
Test the robustness of your model by measuring the worst-case change in model predictions that can be caused by small perturbations to data points.
## Subset Performance Degradation
Test that your model's performance on different subsets of the data has not degraded.
## Data Poisoning Detection
Test for the presence of potentially corrupted samples in your data. Tests in this group scan the evaluation/CT data to find corrupted rows by comparing them against the reference dataset.
## Evasion Attack Detection
Test whether input data contains signs of adversarial evasion attacks that could be used to cause your model to generate incorrect predictions or classifications.
## Model Alignment
Test that your model's responses align with human values, ethical norms, and societal standards, including being helpful, honest, and harmless. Tests in this group apply only to generative question-answering models.
## Factual Awareness
Test that your model produces factually correct outputs.
