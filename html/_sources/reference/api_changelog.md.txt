# API Changelog

## API Versioning
Robust Intelligence aims to provide a stable API that is backwards compatible. To minimize the impact of any necessary breaking changes, we categorize our endpoints as either beta or versioned. The beta endpoints may be subject to breaking changes, while the versioned endpoints are guaranteed to be backwards compatible until deprecation. The version of an endpoint can be identified via the URI (v1/projects vs v1-beta/integrations).

A v1-beta endpoint may be subject to breaking changes. These are typically new features, which may be subject to further optimization.

A major version endpoint (v1, v2, etc.) will not be subject to breaking changes. Once an endpoint has a version upgrade, i.e. from v1 to v2, both versions will be supported for 6 months to allow time for transitioning to the upgraded endpoint. After these 6 months, the older version will be marked deprecated and removed.

## 2.2

PUT /v1/agents/deactivate/{agentId.uuid} api path removed without deprecation. Use DELETE /v1/agents/{agentId.uuid} directly instead.

/v1/firewall api paths are deprecated. They will not be supported from Robust Intelligence v2.4 onwards.

## 2.1

The `delta_lake` connection_info has been renamed to `databricks`. This loads a Databricks Delta Lake Table.
Before:
```python
{
    "connection_info": {
        "delta_lake": {
            "table_name": "Table",
        }
    },
    "data_params": ...,
}
```
After:
```python
{
    "connection_info": {
        "databricks": {
            "table_name": "Table",
        }
    },
    "data_params": ...,
}
```

**Non breaking changes from 2.0 GA to 2.1**

`data_file` type `connection_info` now supports reading a Delta Table from S3. The path to the table and its data type can be specified in a `connection_info` as:
```python
stress_test_config = {
    # other config params
    "connection_info": {
        "data_file": {
            "path": "s3://path/to/table",
            "data_type": "DATA_TYPE_DELTA_TABLE",
        }
    }
}
```

HIDDEN FIELDS

These are needed when the oasdiff tool produces error messages which do not make sense to the end user. Instead of directly exposing these in the docs, we hide them and write a custom message for the end user.
