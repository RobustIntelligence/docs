# DataBricks

These instructions will cover how to install the RIME library on your DataBricks platform.
This assumes you have already set up your DataBricks account and have a cluster deployed.

First, lets navigate to our list of running cluster by selecting the "Cluster" button on the side menu.

Once here, we can select the cluster we want to install the RIME package on. In this example, we have set up a cluster named `rime` that we will install on.

Now we are viewing the configuration for this cluster. We can change view to view the libraries installed on this cluster.

Since this is the first package we are installing, we do not see any packages installed. We can select "Install New" to install a new package.

When this menu pops up, we want to change the type to "Python Whl" and upload the `.whl` we have for RIME.

After uploading our .whl file, we can click "Install".

Finally, after a short while, we should see our package successfully added to library!
