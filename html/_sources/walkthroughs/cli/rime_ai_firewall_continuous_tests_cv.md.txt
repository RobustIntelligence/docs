# AI Firewall Continuous Tests

This tutorial will guide you through how to get started with RIME by running AI
Firewall Continuous Tests on an image classification model using the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cvml.ist.ac.at/AwA2/">
Animals with Attributes 2 Dataset</a>.

### Running Firewall Continuous Tests on the Image Classification Example

#### Running AI Firewall Continuous Tests Trial

To kick off a run of RIME Firewall Continuous Tests Trial:

```bash
rime-engine run-firewall-images-trial --config-path images_examples/classification/awa2/firewall_trial_config.json
```

#### Running AI Firewall Continuous Tests

To kick off a run of RIME Firewall Continuous Tests:

1. Kick off a Stress Testing run (the reference dataset and model from this run will be used for firewall continuous tests).
    ```bash
    rime-engine run-images --config-path images_examples/classification/awa2/stress_test_config.json
   ```
2. Go to the RIME web client, click on the "Default Project" and navigate to the "AI Firewall" tab on the left <img src="../../_static/ui/AIFirewallShield.svg" />. You should see the following page.

3. Click on "Configure AI Firewall" and fill out the details. The "Name" field can be a name of your choice. The "AI Stress Test" field should be "Image Classification" (this refers to the AI Stress Testing run that we just ran). Finally, the "Bin Size" field should be "1 Day". Once you've filled everything out, you should record the "Firewall ID" (you will need this later to upload data and predictions to monitor) and click "Done".

4. Using the Firewall ID we just generated, we can now upload data and predictions and run AI Firewall Continuous Tests.
    ```bash
    rime-engine run-firewall-images --config-path images_examples/classification/awa2/firewall_config.json --firewall-id <FIREWALL-ID>
    ```
