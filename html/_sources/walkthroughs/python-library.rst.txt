Python Library 
================================

This tutorial will guide you through how to get started with using the RIME Library in your Jupyter notebook.

Similar to the `RIME Stress Testing Tutorial <cli/rime_ai_stress_testing.html>`__,
we will be using the `IEEE-CIS Fraud Detection dataset <https://www.kaggle.com/c/ieee-fraud-detection>`__.

Since the RIME Library is directly accessible after installing our python package, please make sure to complete the steps in
`Installation <../get_started/installation.html>`__ first.
